Commands:

- üìú get_authors_list: Retrieve a list of all authors.
  Example: /get_authors_list

- üìö get_author_publication: Get the latest publications of a specific author. By default, it fetches the most recent one. To specify how many publications you'd like, provide the author's name followed by a comma and the number of publications.
  Example: /get_author_publication Jane Doe, 3 (This will retrieve the 3 latest publications by Jane Doe.)

- üìÑ process_pdf: Share and process a PDF file from your local computer. You can also include custom questions about the PDF by writing them next to the command, separated by a `/`.
  Example: /process_pdf Does the paper discuss the impact of AI on society? / What are the key findings of the paper?

- üîó process_publication_doi: Process a publication using its DOI (Digital Object Identifier). Just enter the DOI after the command.
  Example: /process_publication_doi example-doi

- üìù process_publication_title: Process a publication by its title. Simply enter the title after the command.
  Example: /process_publication_title The Future of AI in 2024

Feel free to ask me questions or share your files for processing!
