  "Closing the Execution Gap in Generative AI for Chemicals and Materials: Freeways or Safeguards": {
    "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a tiny subset can practically be made and tested for a given task. Of those, a mere handful will advance to the clinic or the market because of regulatory and economic factors, like Food and Drug Administration approval or Capital Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is slow, expensive, and high stakes; committing to the wrong chemical can ruin a clinical trial or doom a consumer device. Generative AI has undoubtedly broadened and accelerated the early stages of chemical design. However, real-world success takes place further downstream, where the impact of AI has been limited so far. Here, we identify the nature of this \u2018execution gap\u2019and analyze its technical and social sources with a focus on the domain-specific nuances that separate chemistry and materials from other applications of AI. We explore strategies to address the gap and include directions for algorithmic development, strategies for efficient creation and sharing of data, and maximization of feedback between early discovery and downstream validation. Like any powerful technology, generative AI in chemistry brings ethical concerns and dual-use risks. In our analysis, these are not as critical or immediate as they are in other applications of AI. Precisely because of the execution gap, AI has so far not meaningfully lowered the barrier for bad actors to produce chemicals known to be harmful and nor has AI creativity practically broadened the risk spectrum in terms of the types and severity of potential misuse.",

  "Investigating the influence of treatments on carbon felts for vanadium redox flow batteries": {
    "abstract": "Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) electrodes face challenges related to their long\u2010term operation. We investigated different electrode treatments mimicking the aging processes during operation, including thermal activation, aging, soaking, and storing. Several characterization techniques were used to deepen the understanding of the treatment of carbon felts. Synchrotron X\u2010ray imaging, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with the distribution of relaxation times analysis, and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) revealed differences between the wettability of felts. The bulk saturation after electrolyte injection into the carbon felts significantly differed from 8\u2009% to 96\u2009%. DVS revealed differences in the sorption/desorption behavior of carbon felt ranging from a slight change of 0.8\u2005wt\u2009% to over 100\u2005wt\u2009%. Additionally, the interactions between the water vapor and the sample change from type V to type H2 \u2026",

  "Reactive Carbon Capture Enables CO2 Electrolysis with Liquid Feedstocks": {
    "abstract": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is a promising strategy for mitigating global CO2 emissions while simultaneously yielding valuable chemicals and fuels, such as CO, HCOO\u2013, and C2H4. This approach becomes especially appealing when integrated with surplus renewable electricity, as the ensuing production of fuels could facilitate the closure of the carbon cycle. Despite these advantages, the realization of industrial-scale electrolyzers fed with CO2 will be challenged by the substantial energy inputs required to isolate, pressurize, and purify CO2 prior to electrolysis.To address these challenges, we devised an electrolyzer capable of directly converting reactive carbon solutions (e.g., a bicarbonate-rich eluent that exits a carbon capture unit) into higher value products. This \u201creactive carbon electrolyzer\u201d operates by reacting (bi)carbonate with acid generated within the \u2026",

    "abstract": "Of considerable interest to the venture capital community is the nature of the contracts formed by entrepreneurs and investors and the impact that those agreements have on financial outcomes. Sahlman (1988) observed that the goal of this contracting exercise is to decide how the interested parties divide the future risks of the deal as well as the ownership of the future cash flows it generates. Importantly, he argued that how the value of the overall enterprise is split between the suppliers and users of financial capital will be determined by these negotiations. Kaplan and Str\u00f6mberg (2003) documented that VC contracts generally provide separate provisions for cash flow and company control rights, which can impact firm valuations. Cumming (2008) and Cumming and Johan (2014) showed that the control rights negotiated initially influence how the company eventually exits (ie, by public offering or acquisition). Ewens \u2026",

To elucidate the cell-penetrating ability of oxadiazole-containing (Odz) peptides, we employed the Chloroalkane Penetration Assay. The present study demonstrates that Odz cyclic peptides can be highly cell-penetrant depending on the position of specific side chains and the chloroalkane tag. Solution NMR shows that Odz cyclic peptides adopt a \u03b2-turn conformation. However, despite observing high cell penetration, we observed low passive permeability in experiments with artificial membranes.

However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction reduces selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, a reaction in which the formation of CO, and its ensuing coupling, are each essential to achieving multicarbon (C2+) product formation. These two reactions rely on distinct catalyst properties that are difficult to achieve in a single catalyst. Here we report decoupling the CO2-to-C2+ reaction into two steps, CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+, by deploying two distinct catalyst layers operating in tandem to achieve the desired transformation. The first catalyst, atomically dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine, reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity.

  "Evaluating the feasibility of medium chain oleochemical synthesis using microbial chain elongation": {
    "abstract": "Chain elongating bacteria are a unique guild of strictly anaerobic bacteria that have garnered interest for sustainable chemical manufacturing from carbon-rich wet and gaseous waste streams. They produce C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids which are valuable platform chemicals that can be used directly, or derivatized to service a wide range of chemical industries. However, the application of chain elongating bacteria for synthesizing products beyond C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids has not been evaluated. In this study, we assess the feasibility of expanding the product spectrum of chain elongating bacteria to C9-C12 fatty acids, along with the synthesis of C6 fatty alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, diols, and methyl ketones. We propose several metabolic engineering strategies to accomplish these conversions in chain elongating bacteria and utilize constraint-based metabolic modelling to predict pathway stoichiometries, assess thermodynamic feasibility, and estimate ATP and product yields. We also evaluate how producing alternative products impacts the growth rate of chain elongating bacteria via resource allocation modelling, revealing a trade-off between product carbon length and class versus cell growth rate. Together, these results highlight the potential for using chain elongating bacteria as a platform for diverse oleochemical biomanufacturing and offer a starting point for guiding future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at expanding their product range.",

  "Ru-doped functional porous materials for electrocatalytic water splitting": {
    "abstract": "Electrolytic water splitting (EWS) is an attractive and promising technique for the production of hydrogen energy. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetic rate of hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions leads to a high overpotential and low energy efficiency. Up to date, Pt/Ir-based nanocatalysts have become the state-of-the-art EWS catalysts, but disadvantages such as high cost and low earth abundance greatly limit their applications in EWS devices. As an attractive candidate for the Pt/Ir catalysts, series of Ru-based nanomaterials have aroused much attention for their low price, Pt-like hydrogen bond strength, and high EWS activity. In particular, Ru-doped functional porous materials have been becoming one of the most representative EWS catalysts, which can not only achieve the dispersion and adjustment for active Ru sites, but also simultaneously solve the problems of mass transfer and catalytic conversion in EWS.

  "Towards comprehensive coverage of chemical space: Quantum mechanical properties of 836k constitutional and conformational closed shell neutral isomers consisting of HCNOFSiPSClBr": {
    "abstract": "The Vector-QM24 (VQM24) dataset attempts to more comprehensively cover all possible neutral closed shell small organic and inorganic molecules and their conformers at state of the art level of theory. We have used density functional theory (B97X-D3/cc-pVDZ) to optimize 577k conformational isomers corresponding to 258k constitutional isomers.Isomers included contain up to five heavy atoms (non-hydrogen) consisting of -block elements C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br. Single point diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC@PBE0(ccECP/cc-pVQZ)) energies are reported for the sub-set of the lowest conformers of 10,793 molecules with up to 4 heavy atoms.This dataset has been systematically generated by considering all combinatorially possible stoichiometries, and graphs (according to Lewis rules as implemented in the {\tt SURGE} package), along with all stable conformers identified by GFN2-xTB. Apart from graphs, geometries, rotational constants, and vibrational normal modes, VQM24 includes internal, atomization, electron-electron repulsion, exchange correlation, dispersion, vibrational frequency, Gibbs free, enthalpy, ZPV, molecular orbital energies; as well as entropy, and heat capacities. Electronic properties include multipole moments (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, hexadecapole), electrostatic potentials at nuclei (alchemical potential), Mulliken charges, and molecular wavefunctions. VQM24 represents a highly accurate and unbiased dataset of molecules, ideal for testing and training transferable, scalable, and generative ML models of real quantum systems.",

  "Navigating the Materials Space with ML-Generated Electronic Fingerprints": {
    "abstract": "Finding materials with good performance in a specific application, especially when the origin of good performance is not well understood or not easily computable, is a major challenge in materials science. Trial-and-error random exploration is prohibitively expensive due to the vastness of the materials space. A more practical approach is to search for new materials within the proximity of known compounds that possess the desired property. In such an approach, assessing materials’ similarity requires deriving some fingerprint relevant for material’s performance. Typically, material’s structure is used as the fingerprint, which often does not translate into similarity in properties. Electronic structure fingerprints, e.g., density of states (DOS) or electronic band structure, were proposed as a better alternative, however, the computational cost of their calculation on the scale of 100,000 materials remains too high for rapid exploration. In this work, we developed a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) ProDosNet which is trained on orbital-resolved and atom-resolved projected density of states (PDOS) data and is capable of predicting the electronic structure of materials at extremely low computational cost. With this model, we were able to generate PDOS fingerprints for all compounds present in the Materials Projects database and cluster them by similarity of their orbital-resolved PDOS. We demonstrate that these electronic fingerprints allow finding materials with similar electronic properties but drastically different structures for applications in photovoltaics, catalysis, and batteries.",

Mapping this workflow onto material discovery, a new diffusion model was developed for the generation of pure silica zeolite, marking one of the first applications of diffusion models to porous materials. Our model demonstrates the ability to generate novel crystalline porous materials that are not present in the training dataset, while exhibiting exceptional performance in inverse design tasks targeted on various chemical properties including the void fraction, Henry coefficient and heat of adsorption. Comparing our model with a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) revealed that the diffusion model outperforms the GAN in terms of structure validity, exhibiting an over 2000-fold improvement in performance. We firmly believe that diffusion models (along with other deep generative models) hold immense potential in revolutionizing the design of new materials, and anticipate the wide extension of our model to other classes of porous materials.",
