The thiazole-methyl group of MZ1 was selected as the site for DNA attachment, minimizing disruption of the ternary complex.\n\nThe library synthesis involved functionalizing the VHL ligand with a connector library and appending it to DNA using split-and-pool DEL synthesis methods. Each connector terminated with an amine that was functionalized with 22 Fmoc-amino acid connectors. The Fmoc groups were replaced by acetyl groups, and each compound was assayed for binding to VHL. Fifteen connectors that retained binding to VHL were selected for inclusion in the CIP-DEL library.\n\n**Affinity Screening**\n\nThe affinity screening strategy involved parallel screens with the protein of interest (BRD4BD2) +/- the E3 ubiquitin ligase (VHL). Enrichment signals that remained high in both screens suggested library members capable of stable ternary complex induction.",

To bridge this gap, it's essential to develop algorithms that can generalize applicability, promote collaboration between tech, chemical industry, and academia, and create open data initiatives.\n\nOverall, AI algorithms have the potential to revolutionize chemistry education and research, but we must acknowledge the challenges and limitations involved, as well as the importance of addressing social factors, ethics, and risk management concerns.",
