By predicting m and m in a rolling fashion, we are able to continuously reconstruct the discharge capacity loss throughout a battery's lifetime using the most recent cycling history, regardless of the state of health the battery is in.\n\nWe benchmark our approach by systematically changing the input and prediction window sizes, comparing it with a naive model that extrapolates the discharge capacity in case of likely degrading batteries.

The specific details of the ML model are not specified in this text. However, I can provide a general methods description based on what is mentioned:\n\nThe analysis involved evaluating a simple method (presumably an ML model) using leave-one-out cross-validation on the SuperCon data set. The results suggested that certain materials may have high pressures (>250 K) and potentially transition to their superconducting phase across a range of temperatures. Additionally, filtering for metal-like materials with small band gaps (<1.000 eV) allowed for identifying specific samples with accurate predictions.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive description of the methods used, as more details may be present in the context or other sections of the text.", "models": "According to the provided context, the models used in the article appear to be:\n\n1. Machine Learning (ML) models: These models were used for leave-one-out cross-validation on the full SuperCon data set and were found to be relatively robust in making accurate predictions.\n2. Ridge Regression: This model was used to predict label values beyond those found in the training set, but its predictive power was shown to be poor in a quadratic toy problem due to non-linearity.\n3. Kernel Ridge Regression: This model was also tested on the same quadratic toy problem and exhibited good performance on the training set but failed to predict a single value of y beyond Y.\n4. XGBoost Regression: This model was used for regression tasks, including predicting label values beyond those found in the training set.\n\nPlease note that I don't have information about other models or approaches mentioned in the article, so if you're looking for a comprehensive list of models, this might not be exhaustive.", "funding": "No, the article does not mention who funded it."}}
