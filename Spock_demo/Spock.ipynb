    "# Spock: LLM-based Tool for Bibliometric Analysis of  Scientific Literature\n",

    "### Tool Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers often need to work with peer publications within their lab, which can be both time-consuming and resource-demanding. This involves obtaining structured data, conducting thorough literature reviews, and post-processing findings to support their research objectives. \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capability of understanding and generating natural language text bring promising opportunities that can be integrated into a researcher's daily life to simply enhance automation and research pace.\n",
    "One such integration is the Spock, a bibliometric analysis tool integrated within Slack, designed to interact with the Acceleration Consortium members' Google scholar profile.\n",
    "The workflow follows an automatic retrieval of authors' peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed papers and patents from journals and preprint servers (i.e., arXiv, chemRxiv) submissions.\n",
    "This data is then post-processed via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allowing an in-depth analysis of papers by giving, for instance, details about the scientific workflow and techniques used by the author of a scientific paper or describing AI/screening algorithms mentioned in the paper. Multi-class classification of the publication's topics in accelerated materials discovery is also an important feature of our tool. \n",
    "It can provide insights by keeping a systematic track of what researchers at the Laboratory are writing, compare research groups within the organization over several years to identify trends and opportunities, and facilitate easier interaction among scientists. Finally, it helps in preparing and submitting future research proposals.\n"

      "The method employed to extract features from 2-D images involves the following steps:\n",

      "1. Image Segmentation: The algorithm starts by selecting a random slice and performing image segmentation. This step assigns a label to each pixel of the image such that pixels with the same label have similar visual characteristics.\n",
      "2. Thresholding: The easiest segmentation approach is thresholding, where any pixels whose intensity levels exceed the threshold are fixed to a foreground value, while the other pixels have a background value.\n",
      "3. Adaptive Thresholding: In this study, adaptive thresholding was used instead of conventional thresholding. This involves using an algorithm in MATLAB that dynamically changes the threshold value at different parts of the image.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feature extracted from the segmented image is the histogram of the distance map, which captures the statistical distribution of the pore and solid through a membrane. The Euclidean distance between each pixel and the nearest non-zero pixel was calculated to generate this feature.\n",

Use morphological closing to smooth sharp corners and make pores more circular.\\n\\nThis workflow is used to generate 3-D porous structures that can be optimized for membrane development.', 'methods': 'Yes, I can help with that! Based on the provided context, here is a methods description:\\n\\nThe method employed to extract features from 2-D images involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Image Segmentation: The algorithm starts by selecting a random slice and performing image segmentation. This step assigns a label to each pixel of the image such that pixels with the same label have similar visual characteristics.\\n2. Thresholding: The easiest segmentation approach is thresholding, where any pixels whose intensity levels exceed the threshold are fixed to a foreground value, while the other pixels have a background value.\\n3. Adaptive Thresholding: In this study, adaptive thresholding was used instead of conventional thresholding. This involves using an algorithm in MATLAB that dynamically changes the threshold value at different parts of the image.\\n\\nThe feature extracted from the segmented image is the histogram of the distance map, which captures the statistical distribution of the pore and solid through a membrane. The Euclidean distance between each pixel and the nearest non-zero pixel was calculated to generate this feature.\\n\\nThese methods allowed for the calculation of the tortuosity of the membrane using a single 2-D micrograph with high accuracy and low standard deviation.', 'models': \"According to the text, two main models were used:\\n\\n1. **Pore Network Model**: This model is used to describe the void/solid phase as a collection of bodies and throats (Fig. 5). It was employed to quantify the membrane properties.\\n2. **FlowDict module** and **FilterDict-Media solver**: These modules are part of the GeoDict software, which were used to assess the water flux through the 3-D structure and model gold nanoparticle retention under a pressure difference.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!\", 'funding': \"I don't know.

Cell penetration of cyclic peptides (Odz macrocycles)\\n2. Comparison of cell penetration between Odz macrocycles and small molecule controls\\n3. Effect of lysine and chloroalkane tag position on cell penetration\\n4. Passive membrane permeability and lipophilicity of cyclic peptides\\n\\nThese topics are related to the study of cellular uptake mechanisms and the design of bioactive molecules, which is a key area of research in chemical biology.', 'new materials': 'No, this article does not mention a new material discovery. The article is focused on studying the conformational properties and cell-penetrating ability of Odz macrocycles, which are small cyclic peptides. The authors investigate the effects of different substitutions and modifications on the structure and function of these molecules, but they do not report the discovery of any new materials.', 'screening algorithms': \"Based on the provided context, it appears that there is no specific mention of a screening algorithm being used in this paper. The study focuses on the cell penetration mechanism and stability of various peptides (compounds 1-7) using CAPA (Cell Penetration Assay) and PAMPA (Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay) assays, as well as conformation analysis by NMR spectroscopy.\\n\\nHowever, if we consider the methods used in the study, one could argue that the following algorithms are implicitly being used:\\n\\n1. Conformation analysis algorithm: This involves analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the peptides using NMR spectroscopy to understand their potential for cell penetration.\\n2. Cell penetration mechanism identification algorithm: The study aims to identify the mechanisms by which peptides penetrate cells, which involves comparing the results from CAPA and PAMPA assays.\\n\\nWhile these algorithms are not explicitly stated in the paper, they can be inferred as being used implicitly in the analysis of the peptide's properties and behavior.\", 'AI algorithms': \"The provided context does not contain information related to AI algorithms or the question you've asked.

This was done by measuring the retention time (T) on a C18 stationary phase, which is a proxy for the compound's overall lipophilicity.\\n\\nThe workflow appears to be focused on understanding the relationship between the chemical structure of the Odz cyclic peptides and their ability to cross cellular membranes, as well as how changes in side chains affect this property.\", 'methods': 'Based on the provided text, here is a possible methods description:\\n\\n**Cell Penetration Assay (CAPA)**\\n\\n* The cell penetration of compounds was measured using a CAPA assay.\\n* Cyclic peptides were incubated with cells in Opti-MEM for 30 minutes or 4 hours prior to chasing with CT-dye.\\n\\n**Passive Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA)**\\n\\n* The passive membrane permeability of cyclic peptides was measured using a PAMPA assay.\\n* The retention time on reverse-phase HPLC was used as a measure of relative lipophilicity.\\n\\n**Reverse-Phase HPLC**\\n\\n* Reverse-phase HPLC was used to determine the retention time of compounds and their relative lipophilicity.\\n* The gradient 95%/5% MeCN to 100% MeCN over 15 minutes was used for separation.\\n\\nPlease note that this is a summary of the methods description based on the provided text, and it might not be an exact representation of the actual experimental procedures.', 'models': 'Based on the provided context, the models used in the article appear to be:\\n\\n1. CAPA (cell-based assay): measures cell penetration in living cells.\\n2. PAMPA (parallel artificial membrane permeation assay): measures passive permeability.\\n\\nAdditionally, the article mentions the use of LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) with a C18 column and a gradient of 95%/5% MeCN to 100% MeCN over 15 minutes to determine retention time values.', 'funding': 'The article mentions that \"© 2024 The Author(s).
