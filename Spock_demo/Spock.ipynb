    "# Spock: LLM-based Tool for Bibliometric Analysis of  Scientific Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers often need to work with peer publications within their lab, which can be both time-consuming and resource-demanding. This involves obtaining structured data, conducting thorough literature reviews, and post-processing findings to support their research objectives. \n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) and their capability of understanding and generating natural language text bring promising opportunities that can be integrated into a researcher's daily life to simply enhance automation and research pace.\n",
    "One such integration is the Spock, a bibliometric analysis tool integrated within Slack, designed to interact with the Acceleration Consortium members' Google scholar profile.\n",
    "The workflow follows an automatic retrieval of authors' peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed papers and patents from journals and preprint servers (i.e., arXiv, chemRxiv) submissions.\n",
    "This data is then post-processed via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allowing an in-depth analysis of papers by giving, for instance, details about the scientific workflow and techniques used by the author of a scientific paper or describing AI/screening algorithms mentioned in the paper. Multi-class classification of the publication's topics in accelerated materials discovery is also an important feature of our tool. \n",
    "It can provide insights by keeping a systematic track of what researchers at the Laboratory are writing, compare research groups within the organization over several years to identify trends and opportunities, and facilitate easier interaction among scientists. Finally, it helps in preparing and submitting future research proposals.\n"
