    "abstract": "lithium-ion batteries (libs) have attracted widespread attention as an efficient energy storage device on electric vehicles (ev) to achieve emission-free mobility. however, the performance of libs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to quantify. having accurate estimations of a battery\u2019s remaining life across different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying used batteries for second-life applications. since the full history of a battery may not always be available in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that enables dynamic degradation rate prediction, including both short-term and long-term forecasting, while requiring only the most recent battery usage information. specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series inputs, and predicts the near-term and \u2026",
