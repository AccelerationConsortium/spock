    "abstract": "The genetic circuits that allow cancer cells to evade destruction by the host immune system remain poorly understood13. Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-? (IFN?). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFN? andTNF. Through the mapping of cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in vivo CRISPR screens, we show how the pleiotropic effects of autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the tumour microenvironment. Collectively, thesedata expand our knowledge of the genetic circuits that are involved in the evasion of the immune system by cancer cells, and highlight genetic interactions that contribute to phenotypes associated with escape from killing by CTLs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have few therapeutic options, as ccRCC is unresponsive to chemotherapy and is highly resistant to radiation. Recently targeted therapies have extended progression-free survival, but responses are variable and no significant overall survival benefit has been achieved. Commercial ccRCC cell lines are often used as model systems to develop novel therapeutic approaches, but these do not accurately recapitulate primary ccRCC tumors at the genomic and transcriptional levels. Furthermore, ccRCC exhibits significant intertumor genetic heterogeneity, and the limited cell lines available fail to represent this aspect of ccRCC. Our objective was to generate accurate preclinical in vitro models of ccRCC using tumor tissues from ccRCC patients. Methods: ccRCC primary single cell suspensions were cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing media or defined serum-free media. Established cultures were characterized by genomic verification of mutations present in the primary tumors, expression of renal epithelial markers, and transcriptional profiling. Results: The apparent efficiency of primary cell culture establishment was high in both culture conditions, but genotyping revealed that the majority of cultures contained normal, not cancer cells. ccRCC characteristically shows biallelic loss of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, leading to accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and expression of HIF target genes. Purification of cells based on expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a cell surface HIF target, followed by culture in FBS enabled establishment of ccRCC cell cultures with an efficiency of >80 %. Culture in serum-free conditions selected for growth of normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Transcriptional profiling of ccRCC and matched normal cell cultures identified up- and down-regulated networks in ccRCC and comparison to The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed the clinical validity of our cell cultures. Conclusions: The ability to establish primary cultures of ccRCC cells and matched normal kidney epithelial cells from almost every patient provides a resource for future development of novel therapies and personalized medicine for ccRCC patients.",

Despite its utility as a cancer progenitor cell marker, CD133 protein regulation and molecular function remain poorly understood. We find that the deacetylase HDAC6 physically associates with CD133 to negatively regulate CD133 trafficking down the endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation. We further demonstrate that CD133, HDAC6, and the central molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, ?-catenin, can physically associate as a ternary complex. This association stabilizes ?-catenin via HDAC6 deacetylase activity, which leads to activation of ?-catenin signaling targets. Downregulation of either CD133 or HDAC6 results in increased ?-catenin acetylation and degradation, which correlates with decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo.

Therefore, molecules that restore sensitivity to death receptor stimuli would be important tools to better understand this biological pathway and potential leads for therapeutic adjuncts. Previously, the small-molecule 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N- hydroxybutanamide (that we propose be named droxinostat) was identified as a chemical sensitizer to death receptor stimuli, decreasing the expression of the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP. However, the direct targets of droxinostat were unknown. To better understand the mechanism of action of droxinostat and highlight new strategies to restore sensitivity to death receptor ligands, we analyzed changes in gene expression using the Connectivity Map after treating cells with droxinostat. Changes in gene expression after droxinostat treatment resembled changes observed after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Therefore, we examined the effects of droxinostat on HDAC activity and showed that it selectively inhibited HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 and that inhibition of these HDACs was functionally important for its ability to sensitize cells to death ligands. Thus, we have identified a selective HDAC inhibitor and showed that selective HDAC inhibition sensitizes cells to death ligands, thereby highlighting a new mechanism to overcome resistance to death receptor ligands. 2010 AACR.",

Knockdown of E1 decreased the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia and myeloma cells and induced cell death.

    "abstract": "Antibodies are used in multiple cell biology applications, but there are no standardized methods to assess antibody quality - an absence that risks data integrity and reproducibility. We describe a mass spectrometry-based standard operating procedure for scoring immunoprecipitation antibody quality. We quantified the abundance of all the proteins in immunoprecipitates of 1,124 new recombinant antibodies for 152 chromatin-related human proteins by comparing normalized spectral abundance factors from the target antigen with those of all other proteins. We validated the performance of the standard operating procedure in blinded studies in five independent laboratories. Antibodies for which the target antigen or a member of its known protein complex was the most abundant protein were classified as 'IP gold standard'. This method generates quantitative outputs that can be stored and archived in public databases, and it represents a step toward a platform for community benchmarking of antibody quality.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme found in all eukaryotes that catalyzes the removal of ubiquitin from specific target proteins. Here, we report that UbE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme with a unique N-terminal extension, is a novel USP7-interacting protein. USP7 forms a complex with UbE2E1 in vitro and in vivo through theASTSUSP7 binding motif within its N-terminal extension in an identical manner with other known USP7 binding proteins. We show that USP7 attenuates UbE2E1-mediated ubiquitination, an effect that requires the N-terminal ASTS sequence of UbE2E1 as well as the catalytic activity of USP7. Additionally, USP7 is critical in maintaining the steady state levels of UbE2E1 in cells. This study reveals a new cellular mechanism that couples the opposing activities of the ubiquitination machinery and a deubiquitinating enzyme to maintain and modulate the dynamic balance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

    "abstract": "USP7/HAUSP is a key regulator of p53 and Mdm2 and is targeted by the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We have determined the crystal structure of the p53 binding domain of USP7 alone and bound to an EBNA1 peptide. This domain is an eight-stranded ? sandwich similar to the TRAF-C domains of TNF-receptor associated factors, although the mode of peptide binding differs significantly from previously observed TRAF-peptide interactions in the sequence (DPGEGPS) and the conformation of the bound peptide. NMR chemical shift analyses of USP7 bound by EBNA1 and p53 indicated that p53 binds the same pocket as EBNA1 but makes less extensive contacts with USP7. Functional studies indicated that EBNA1 binding to USP7 can protect cells from apoptotic challenge by lowering p53 levels. The data provide a structural and conceptual framework for understanding how EBNA1 might contribute to the survival of Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells. Copyright 2005 by Elsevier Inc.",
