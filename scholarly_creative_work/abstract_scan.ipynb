      "55095, Journal article, 01/10/2020, , The genetic circuits that allow cancer cells to evade destruction by the host immune system remain poorly understood13. Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-? (IFN?). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFN? andTNF. Through the mapping of cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in vivo CRISPR screens, we show how the pleiotropic effects of autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the tumour microenvironment. Collectively, thesedata expand our knowledge of the genetic circuits that are involved in the evasion of the immune system by cancer cells, and highlight genetic interactions that contribute to phenotypes associated with escape from killing by CTLs., , , , , , , Lawson KA, Sousa CM, Zhang X, Kim E, Akthar R, Caumanns JJ, Yao Y, Mikolajewicz N, Ross C, Brown KR, Zid AA, Fan ZP, Hui S, Krall JA, Simons DM, Slater CJ, De Jesus V, Tang L, Singh R, Goldford JE, Martin S, Huang Q, Francis EA, Habsid A, Climie R, Tieu D, Wei J, Li R, Tong AHY, Aregger M, Chan KS, Han H, Wang X, Mero P, Brumell JH, Finelli A, Ailles L, Bader G, Smolen GA, Kingsbury GA, Hart T, Kung C, Moffat J, , , , , , 10.1038/s41586-020-2746-2, , , 1476-4687, , pubmed:32968282, , , , , , , , , 0028-0836, 7827, Nature, , , , , , , , , , , , , 120, 126, , , , , , 10/1/2020, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , Functional genomic landscape of cancer-intrinsic evasion of killing by T cells, Journal Article, , 586, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 232, Nature (0028-0836), A*, Nature (0028-0836), 17.875, Nature: New biology (0090-0028), 8.524, No, , , , , , 2-s2.0-85091384926, Scopus, Nature\n",
      "55140, Journal article, 16/07/2016, , Background: Patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have few therapeutic options, as ccRCC is unresponsive to chemotherapy and is highly resistant to radiation. Recently targeted therapies have extended progression-free survival, but responses are variable and no significant overall survival benefit has been achieved. Commercial ccRCC cell lines are often used as model systems to develop novel therapeutic approaches, but these do not accurately recapitulate primary ccRCC tumors at the genomic and transcriptional levels. Furthermore, ccRCC exhibits significant intertumor genetic heterogeneity, and the limited cell lines available fail to represent this aspect of ccRCC. Our objective was to generate accurate preclinical in vitro models of ccRCC using tumor tissues from ccRCC patients. Methods: ccRCC primary single cell suspensions were cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing media or defined serum-free media. Established cultures were characterized by genomic verification of mutations present in the primary tumors, expression of renal epithelial markers, and transcriptional profiling. Results: The apparent efficiency of primary cell culture establishment was high in both culture conditions, but genotyping revealed that the majority of cultures contained normal, not cancer cells. ccRCC characteristically shows biallelic loss of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, leading to accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and expression of HIF target genes. Purification of cells based on expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a cell surface HIF target, followed by culture in FBS enabled establishment of ccRCC cell cultures with an efficiency of >80 %. Culture in serum-free conditions selected for growth of normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Transcriptional profiling of ccRCC and matched normal cell cultures identified up- and down-regulated networks in ccRCC and comparison to The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed the clinical validity of our cell cultures. Conclusions: The ability to establish primary cultures of ccRCC cells and matched normal kidney epithelial cells from almost every patient provides a resource for future development of novel therapies and personalized medicine for ccRCC patients., , , , , , , Lobo NC, Gedye C, Apostoli AJ, Brown KR, Paterson J, Stickle N, Robinette M, Fleshner N, Hamilton RJ, Kulkarni G, Zlotta A, Evans A, Finelli A, Moffat J, Jewett MAS, Ailles L, , , , , , 10.1186/s12885-016-2539-z, , , 1471-2407, , pubmed:27422173, , , , , , , , , , 1, BMC Cancer, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 7/16/2016, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , Efficient generation of patient-matched malignant and normal primary cell cultures from clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients: Clinically relevant models for research and personalized medicine, Journal Article, , 16, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 23, BMC Cancer (1471-2407), B, BMC Cancer (1471-2407), 1.464, BMC Cancer (1471-2407), 1.066, Yes, CC BY, CC0, 0, http://hdl.handle.net/1807/83949, Yes, Live, 2-s2.0-84978197041, Scopus, BMC Cancer\n",
      "55173, Journal article, 01/01/2014, , Cell signaling, one of key processes in both normal cellular function and disease, is coordinated by numerous interactions between membrane proteins that change in response to stimuli. We present a split ubiquitin-based method for detection of integral membrane protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human cells, termed mammalian-membrane two-hybrid assay (MaMTH). We show that this technology detects stimulus (hormone or agonist)-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. MaMTH can detect changes in PPIs conferred by mutations such as those in oncogenic ErbB receptor variants or by treatment with drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Using MaMTH as a screening assay, we identified CRKII as an interactor of oncogenic EGFR(L858R) and showed that CRKII promotes persistent activation of aberrant signaling in non-small cell lung cancer cells. MaMTH is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic interactomes of human integral membrane proteins.  2014 Nature America, Inc., , , , , , , Petschnigg J, Groisman B, Kotlyar M, Taipale M, Zheng Y, Kurat CF, Sayad A, Sierra JR, Usaj MM, Snider J, Nachman A, Krykbaeva I, Tsao MS, Moffat J, Pawson T, Lindquist S, Jurisica I, Stagljar I, , , , , , 10.1038/nmeth.2895, , , 1548-7105, , pubmed:24658140, , , , , , , , , 1548-7091, 5, Nature Methods, , , , , , , , , , , , , 585, 592, , , , , , 1/1/2014, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , The mammalian-membrane two-hybrid assay (MaMTH) for probing membrane-protein interactions in human cells, Journal Article, , 11, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 114, Nature Methods (1548-7091), A*, Nature Methods (1548-7091), 19.939, Nature Methods (1548-7091), 4.641, No, , 0, http://hdl.handle.net/1807/69825, Yes, Live, 2-s2.0-84899903279, Scopus, Nature Methods\n",
      "55191, Journal article, 25/10/2012, , The pentaspan membrane glycoprotein CD133 marks lineage-specific cancer progenitor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in a number of tumor types. Despite its utility as a cancer progenitor cell marker, CD133 protein regulation and molecular function remain poorly understood. We find that the deacetylase HDAC6 physically associates with CD133 to negatively regulate CD133 trafficking down the endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation. We further demonstrate that CD133, HDAC6, and the central molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, ?-catenin, can physically associate as a ternary complex. This association stabilizes ?-catenin via HDAC6 deacetylase activity, which leads to activation of ?-catenin signaling targets. Downregulation of either CD133 or HDAC6 results in increased ?-catenin acetylation and degradation, which correlates with decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Given that CD133 marks progenitor cells in a wide range of cancers, targeting CD133 may be a means to treat multiple cancer types, , , , , , , Mak AB, Nixon AML, Kittanakom S, Stewart JM, Chen GI, Curak J, Gingras AC, Mazitschek R, Neel BG, Stagljar I, Moffat J, , , , , , 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.016, , , 2211-1247, , pubmed:23084749, , , , , , , , , , 4, Cell Reports, , , , , , , , , , , , , 951, 963, , , , , , 10/25/2012, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , Regulation of CD133 by HDAC6 Promotes ?-Catenin Signaling to Suppress Cancer Cell Differentiation, Journal Article, , 2, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 160, , , Cell Reports (2211-1247), 7.552, Cell Reports (2211-1247), 1.648, Yes, CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND, , , , , 2-s2.0-84868099762, Scopus, Cell Reports\n",
      "55228, Journal article, 01/01/2010, , Evasion of death receptor ligand-induced apoptosis represents an important contributor to cancer development and progression. Therefore, molecules that restore sensitivity to death receptor stimuli would be important tools to better understand this biological pathway and potential leads for therapeutic adjuncts. Previously, the small-molecule 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N- hydroxybutanamide (that we propose be named droxinostat) was identified as a chemical sensitizer to death receptor stimuli, decreasing the expression of the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP. However, the direct targets of droxinostat were unknown. To better understand the mechanism of action of droxinostat and highlight new strategies to restore sensitivity to death receptor ligands, we analyzed changes in gene expression using the Connectivity Map after treating cells with droxinostat. Changes in gene expression after droxinostat treatment resembled changes observed after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Therefore, we examined the effects of droxinostat on HDAC activity and showed that it selectively inhibited HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 and that inhibition of these HDACs was functionally important for its ability to sensitize cells to death ligands. Thus, we have identified a selective HDAC inhibitor and showed that selective HDAC inhibition sensitizes cells to death ligands, thereby highlighting a new mechanism to overcome resistance to death receptor ligands. 2010 AACR., , , , , , , Wood TE, Dalili S, Simpson CD, Sukhai MA, Hurren R, Anyiwe K, Mao X, Saiz FS, Gronda M, Eberhard Y, MacLean N, Ketela T, Reed JC, Moffat J, Minden MD, Batey RA, Schimmer AD, , , , , , 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0495, , , , , pubmed:20053768, , , , , , , , , 1535-7163, 1, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, , , , , , , , , , , , , 246, 256, , , , , , 1/1/2010, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , Selective inhibition of histone deacetylases sensitizes malignant cells to death receptor ligands, Journal Article, , 9, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 52, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (1535-7163), A, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (1535-7163), 2.755, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (1535-7163), 1.228, No, , , , , , 2-s2.0-73949148023, Scopus, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics\n",
      "55232, Journal article, 18/03/2010, , The proteasomal pathway of protein degradation involves 2 discrete steps: ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting the ubiquitination pathway at the level of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 (E1). By immunoblotting, leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples had increased protein ubiquitination. Therefore, we examined the effects of genetic and chemical inhibition of the E1 enzyme. Knockdown of E1 decreased the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia and myeloma cells and induced cell death. To further investigate effects of E1 inhibition in malignancy, we discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor, 3,5-dioxopyrazolidine compound, 1-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-4-[(5-nitro-2-furyl)methylene]-3, 5-pyrazolidinedione (PYZD-4409). PYZD-4409 induced cell death in malignant cells and preferentially inhibited the clonogenic growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, genetic or chemical inhibition of E1 increased expression of E1 stress markers. Moreover, BI-1 overexpression blocked cell death after E1 inhibition, suggesting ER stress is functionally important for cell death after E1 inhibition. Finally, in a mouse model of leukemia, intraperitoneal administration of PYZD-4409 decreased tumor weight and volume compared with control without untoward toxicity. Thus, our work highlights the E1 enzyme as a novel target for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.  2010 by The American Society of Hematology., , , , , , , Xu GW, Ali M, Wood TE, Wong D, Maclean N, Wang X, Gronda M, Skrtic M, Li X, Hurren R, Mao X, Venkatesan M, Zavareh RB, Ketela T, Reed JC, Rose D, Moffat J, Batey RA, Dhe-Paganon S, Schimmer AD, , , , , , 10.1182/blood-2009-07-231191, , , 1528-0020, , pubmed:20075161, , , , , , , , , 0006-4971, 11, Blood, , , , , , , , , , , , , 2251, 2259, , , , , , 3/18/2010, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , The ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of leukemia and multiple myeloma, Journal Article, , 115, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 133, Blood (0006-4971), A*, Blood (0006-4971), 6.434, Blood (0006-4971), 2.69, No, , , , , , 2-s2.0-77950421253, Scopus, Blood\n",

We describe a mass spectrometry-based standard operating procedure for scoring immunoprecipitation antibody quality. We quantified the abundance of all the proteins in immunoprecipitates of 1,124 new recombinant antibodies for 152 chromatin-related human proteins by comparing normalized spectral abundance factors from the target antigen with those of all other proteins. We validated the performance of the standard operating procedure in blinded studies in five independent laboratories. Antibodies for which the target antigen or a member of its known protein complex was the most abundant protein were classified as 'IP gold standard'.

      "55782, Journal article, 07/06/2013, , Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme found in all eukaryotes that catalyzes the removal of ubiquitin from specific target proteins. Here, we report that UbE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin conjugation enzyme with a unique N-terminal extension, is a novel USP7-interacting protein. USP7 forms a complex with UbE2E1 in vitro and in vivo through theASTSUSP7 binding motif within its N-terminal extension in an identical manner with other known USP7 binding proteins. We show that USP7 attenuates UbE2E1-mediated ubiquitination, an effect that requires the N-terminal ASTS sequence of UbE2E1 as well as the catalytic activity of USP7. Additionally, USP7 is critical in maintaining the steady state levels of UbE2E1 in cells. This study reveals a new cellular mechanism that couples the opposing activities of the ubiquitination machinery and a deubiquitinating enzyme to maintain and modulate the dynamic balance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc., , , , , , , Sarkari F, Wheaton K, La Delfa A, Mohamed M, Shaikh F, Khatun R, Arrowsmith CH, Frappier L, Saridakis V, Sheng Y, , , , , , 10.1074/jbc.M113.469262, , , 1083-351X, , pubmed:23603909, , , , , , , , , 0021-9258, 23, Journal of Biological Chemistry, , , , , , , , , , , , , 16975, 16985, , , , , , 6/7/2013, Published, , , , , , , , , , , , Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 is a regulator of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbE2E1, Journal Article, , 288, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 36, Journal of Biological Chemistry (0021-9258), A*, Journal of Biological Chemistry (0021-9258), 2.672, Journal of Biological Chemistry (0021-9258), 1.085, Yes, , , , , , 2-s2.0-84878753817, Scopus, Journal of Biological Chemistry\n",
      "55811, Journal article, 01/04/2005, , USP7/HAUSP is a key regulator of p53 and Mdm2 and is targeted by the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We have determined the crystal structure of the p53 binding domain of USP7 alone and bound to an EBNA1 peptide. This domain is an eight-stranded ? sandwich similar to the TRAF-C domains of TNF-receptor associated factors, although the mode of peptide binding differs significantly from previously observed TRAF-peptide interactions in the sequence (DPGEGPS) and the conformation of the bound peptide. NMR chemical shift analyses of USP7 bound by EBNA1 and p53 indicated that p53 binds the same pocket as EBNA1 but makes less extensive contacts with USP7. Functional studies indicated that EBNA1 binding to USP7 can protect cells from apoptotic challenge by lowering p53 levels. The data provide a structural and conceptual framework for understanding how EBNA1 might contribute to the survival of Epstein-Barr virus-infected cells.

Methods: ccRCC primary single cell suspensions were cultured in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing media or defined serum-free media. Established cultures were characterized by genomic verification of mutations present in the primary tumors, expression of renal epithelial markers, and transcriptional profiling. Results: The apparent efficiency of primary cell culture establishment was high in both culture conditions, but genotyping revealed that the majority of cultures contained normal, not cancer cells. ccRCC characteristically shows biallelic loss of the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene, leading to accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and expression of HIF target genes. Purification of cells based on expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a cell surface HIF target, followed by culture in FBS enabled establishment of ccRCC cell cultures with an efficiency of >80 %. Culture in serum-free conditions selected for growth of normal renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Transcriptional profiling of ccRCC and matched normal cell cultures identified up- and down-regulated networks in ccRCC and comparison to The Cancer Genome Atlas confirmed the clinical validity of our cell cultures. Conclusions: The ability to establish primary cultures of ccRCC cells and matched normal kidney epithelial cells from almost every patient provides a resource for future development of novel therapies and personalized medicine for ccRCC patients.', '10.1038/nmeth.2895': 'Cell signaling, one of key processes in both normal cellular function and disease, is coordinated by numerous interactions between membrane proteins that change in response to stimuli. We present a split ubiquitin-based method for detection of integral membrane protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human cells, termed mammalian-membrane two-hybrid assay (MaMTH). We show that this technology detects stimulus (hormone or agonist)-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent PPIs. MaMTH can detect changes in PPIs conferred by mutations such as those in oncogenic ErbB receptor variants or by treatment with drugs such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib. Using MaMTH as a screening assay, we identified CRKII as an interactor of oncogenic EGFR(L858R) and showed that CRKII promotes persistent activation of aberrant signaling in non-small cell lung cancer cells. MaMTH is a powerful tool for investigating the dynamic interactomes of human integral membrane proteins.  2014 Nature America, Inc.', '10.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.016': 'The pentaspan membrane glycoprotein CD133 marks lineage-specific cancer progenitor cells and is associated with poor prognosis in a number of tumor types. Despite its utility as a cancer progenitor cell marker, CD133 protein regulation and molecular function remain poorly understood. We find that the deacetylase HDAC6 physically associates with CD133 to negatively regulate CD133 trafficking down the endosomal-lysosomal pathway for degradation. We further demonstrate that CD133, HDAC6, and the central molecule of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, ?-catenin, can physically associate as a ternary complex. This association stabilizes ?-catenin via HDAC6 deacetylase activity, which leads to activation of ?-catenin signaling targets. Downregulation of either CD133 or HDAC6 results in increased ?-catenin acetylation and degradation, which correlates with decreased proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo.

Therefore, molecules that restore sensitivity to death receptor stimuli would be important tools to better understand this biological pathway and potential leads for therapeutic adjuncts. Previously, the small-molecule 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N- hydroxybutanamide (that we propose be named droxinostat) was identified as a chemical sensitizer to death receptor stimuli, decreasing the expression of the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP. However, the direct targets of droxinostat were unknown. To better understand the mechanism of action of droxinostat and highlight new strategies to restore sensitivity to death receptor ligands, we analyzed changes in gene expression using the Connectivity Map after treating cells with droxinostat. Changes in gene expression after droxinostat treatment resembled changes observed after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Therefore, we examined the effects of droxinostat on HDAC activity and showed that it selectively inhibited HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 and that inhibition of these HDACs was functionally important for its ability to sensitize cells to death ligands. Thus, we have identified a selective HDAC inhibitor and showed that selective HDAC inhibition sensitizes cells to death ligands, thereby highlighting a new mechanism to overcome resistance to death receptor ligands. 2010 AACR.', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-231191': 'The proteasomal pathway of protein degradation involves 2 discrete steps: ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting the ubiquitination pathway at the level of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 (E1). By immunoblotting, leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples had increased protein ubiquitination. Therefore, we examined the effects of genetic and chemical inhibition of the E1 enzyme. Knockdown of E1 decreased the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia and myeloma cells and induced cell death. To further investigate effects of E1 inhibition in malignancy, we discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor, 3,5-dioxopyrazolidine compound, 1-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-4-[(5-nitro-2-furyl)methylene]-3, 5-pyrazolidinedione (PYZD-4409). PYZD-4409 induced cell death in malignant cells and preferentially inhibited the clonogenic growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, genetic or chemical inhibition of E1 increased expression of E1 stress markers. Moreover, BI-1 overexpression blocked cell death after E1 inhibition, suggesting ER stress is functionally important for cell death after E1 inhibition. Finally, in a mouse model of leukemia, intraperitoneal administration of PYZD-4409 decreased tumor weight and volume compared with control without untoward toxicity.

USP7 forms a complex with UbE2E1 in vitro and in vivo through theASTSUSP7 binding motif within its N-terminal extension in an identical manner with other known USP7 binding proteins. We show that USP7 attenuates UbE2E1-mediated ubiquitination, an effect that requires the N-terminal ASTS sequence of UbE2E1 as well as the catalytic activity of USP7. Additionally, USP7 is critical in maintaining the steady state levels of UbE2E1 in cells.

Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-? (IFN?). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFN? andTNF. Through the mapping of cytokine- and CTL-based genetic interactions, together with in vivo CRISPR screens, we show how the pleiotropic effects of autophagy control cancer-cell-intrinsic evasion of killing by CTLs and we highlight the importance of these effects within the tumour microenvironment. Collectively, thesedata expand our knowledge of the genetic circuits that are involved in the evasion of the immune system by cancer cells, and highlight genetic interactions that contribute to phenotypes associated with escape from killing by CTLs.',\n",
