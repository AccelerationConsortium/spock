However, it describes an existing method of preventing salt formation by employing a regeneration potential that lowers the reaction rate to nearly 0 mA cm\u22122, eliminating hydroxide formation, while maintaining a sufficiently negative polarization at the cathode to transport carbonate ions to the anode under electromigration.\n\nAs for screening algorithms, there is no mention of any in the provided text."
