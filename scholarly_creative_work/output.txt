While this design is very effective, its application is limited to wound healing wherein the material is \napplied on the surface of the body.\nThere are, however, a wide range of \nother medical procedures and applica-\ntions that require biomedical fixatives such as drug delivery,\n[1] tissue repair and \nreconnection,[2,3] and device attachment \nand engraftment.[4] Sutures and staples \nhave been commonly used, especially in surgical procedures; however, they \nsuffer from significant limitations. They \npierce the surrounding tissue, which can lead to tissue damage and inflammation, and they are time consuming and chal-\nlenging to apply, especially in difficult to \nreach areas\n[5]—a common recent occur -\nrence given the increase in the number of minimally invasive procedures per -\nformed annually.\n[6] Because of these \nlimitations, there has been a shift toward the use of sealants, designed to generate \nfluid or air-tight closures, and adhesives, which are used to bind tissue. However, many currently available sealants and adhesives are rigid,\n[7] causing issues especially when used in \nchallenging, dynamic environments such as contracting tis-sues and organs.\nMore recently, biomedical applications such as tissue engi-\nneering and regeneration, in which biomaterials are used to deliver tissue, cells, bioactive elements or provide mechanical support to restore function or encourage regeneration, have \nbeen established. In these cases, biomaterials must be ade-\nquately confined or secured to a desired location. However, these materials often exist as a uniform material, even though the functional requirement of sufficient adhesion may exist. Therefore, it is conceivable that the development of a bioma-\nterial system resembling the Band-Aid would be highly useful \ndue to its ease of application and ability to adhere to sites, while still providing space for its other intended function, such as cell growth. Furthermore, if its mechanical properties are tuned to \nmatch native tissue, it could address issues that arise with cur -\nrently available rigid fixatives. One application for which this \ndesign would be highly applicable is in scaffolds for soft tissue \nengineering.In order to secure biomaterials to tissue surfaces, sutures or glues are com-\nmonly used. Of interest is the development of a biomaterial patch for applica-\ntions in tissue engineering and regeneration that incorporates an adhesive \ncomponent to simplify patch application and ensure sufficient adhesion. A separate region dedicated to fulfilling the specific requirements of an applica-\ntion such as mechanical support or tissue delivery is also desirable. Here, the \ndesign and fabrication of a unique patch are presented with distinct regions for adhesion and function, resulting in a biomaterial patch resembling the \nBand-Aid. The adhesive region contains a novel polymer, synthesized to \nincorporate a molecule capable of adhesion to tissue, dopamine. The desired polymer composition for patch development is selected based on chemical \nassessment and evaluation of key physical properties such as swelling and \nelastic modulus, which are tailored for use in soft tissue applications. The selected polymer formulation, referred to as the adhesive patch (AP) polymer, \ndemonstrates negligible cytotoxicity and improves adhesive capability to \nrat cardiac tissue compared to currently used patch materials.

KGaA, WeinheimHere, we describe the design and fabrication of a patch \nthat can be used in biomedical applications where mechan-\nical support or tissue delivery via a patch, as well as adhe-\nsion to tissue, is required. We designed a patch which is com-\nprised of two elements: a center scaffold mesh domain and two outer adhesive flaps. In order to do this, we required a material that could adhere to tissue surfaces and also be fab-\nricated into a patch of specific geometry. We required a bio-\nmaterial that can adhere to tissue surfaces relatively rapidly and in a wet environment and that maintains elastic proper -\nties matching those of soft tissues, such as for example the myocardium. We hypothesized that we could make a mate-\nrial with both elastic and adhesive properties, that is also \nmoldable and photocrosslinkable to enable fabrication into a patch of precise geometry controlled at the micrometer-scale. Specifically, we aimed to develop citrate-based poly-\nmers containing dopamine (DA), an amine-derivative of the \n3,4- dihydroxy-l -phenylalanine (l -DOPA) molecule described \nfor use as a surgical adhesive material.\n[8]\nIn this work, we selected a desirable adhesive patch (AP) \nmaterial based on chemical assessment and evaluation of key physical properties. We matched the mechanical properties \n(i.e., elastic modulus) of the polymer patch to that of native car -\ndiac tissue, an example of a soft tissue that would benefit from \nthis scaffold technology, and then tested the adhesive properties \nand cytotoxicity of the patch. This material was then used in \nthe patch consisting of spatially varied regions of adhesion with our novel polymer acting as an adhesive component as well as a distinct region that can contain an alternative composition which can be tuned for the intended function and application. To achieve this, we focused on micromolding, using perfusion of two polymers through a mold to form a uniform patch with regions of adhesive polymer flaps and scaffold mesh. To the \nbest of our knowledge, no adhesive biomaterial patch utilizing \nthis design currently exists.\n2. Results\n2.1. Chemical Characterization\nPrepolymers were synthesized in a reaction between citric \nacid (CA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), maleic anhydride \n(MA), and DA (Figure 1A). Polymers of two compositions \n(Table 1 composition A and B) were synthesized by reacting \nmonomers for the same amount of time (Table 2 condition \nX). For compositions A and B, the ratio of MA to PEG was selected and the amount of DA was then calculated to main-tain equal ratios of total carboxylic acid groups to total alcohol and amine groups. These two compositions are denoted as polymer 1 and polymer 2, respectively. Analysis of the incor -\nporation of specific monomers completed through inte-gration of \n1H NMR peaks associated with those monomers \n(Figure\xa0 1B and Figure S1, Supporting Information) revealed that the ratio of MA incorporated into the final polymer was \nlow for all of the tested compositions. We sought to increase \nthe reaction of this monomer, thereby also potentially fur -\nthering reaction of other monomers as well, by increasing \nFigure 1.

KGaA, Weinheimreaction time and introducing a reduction in pressure. This \nwas accomplished by reacting compositions A and B for 24\xa0h at ambient pressure and 24\xa0 h under vacuum (Table\xa0 2 con-\ndition Y). Composition A under condition Y resulted in a \nsolid material and was therefore not assessed further, as it could not be used for our application. As evidenced by the \n1H NMR analysis, increased integration of MA as well as DA \nwas achieved for the polymer synthesized with composition B under condition Y , denoted as polymer 3.\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed \nthe presence of characteristic functional groups (Figure\xa01C). The peaks at 1532\xa0cm\n−1 were assigned to amide groups, which are \nattributed to the incorporation of DA in the polymer. The peaks \nat 1648\xa0cm−1 were assigned to the carbon–carbon double bond \nthat is present in MA. Peaks around 1720\xa0cm−1 were assigned \nto carbonyl groups and the peaks in the 2860–2935\xa0cm−1 range \nwere assigned to methylene groups. Finally, the peaks around \n3500\xa0 cm−1 were assigned to hydroxyl groups. The presence of \nDA in the purified prepolymer solution was further confirmed using UV-visible spectroscopy (Figure\xa01D). The demonstration \nof UV light absorption at 280\xa0nm wavelength is characteristic \nof the unoxidized catechol structure in DA.\n[8] The observed \nincreased DA content in polymer 3 (1H NMR) is also seen in \nthe UV–vis spectra.\nSince the incorporation of the DA molecule was carried \nout to include an adhesive moiety in the polymer, we sought to increase the DA content further, to achieve more potential for adhesion. The ratio of DA was increased to 0.5 of the rela-tive PEG molar content and we incorporated excess total acid \ncontent to facilitate its incorporation (Table\xa01 composition C). \nMA feed content was increased due to its low incorporation, which we attribute to the need for ring opening reactivity. Furthermore, reaction time was increased (Table\xa0 2 condi-tion Z). Chemical analysis of the resulting polymer, polymer \n4, indicated a higher DA content, as demonstrated through \nFTIR, \n1H NMR, and UV–vis analysis. Furthermore, the MA \ncontent was also assessed to be higher and this is shown by both \n1H NMR analysis and in carbon–carbon double bond \npeak in the FTIR spectra.2.2. Physical Characterization\nThe prepolymers were easily fabricated into solid films using \nphotocrosslinking of the double bonds present in the polymer chain as a result of the MA incorporation. After exposure to UV \nlight with a photoinitiator (PI), the polymer could be handled \nin film format (Figure 2A). The UV energy required to generate \nsolid films that could be removed from their molds was evalu-ated (Figure\xa02B). Although polymer 4 had a higher ratio of MA \nthan the other polymer compositions, the energy required to \ngenerate a solid film was notably higher. Crosslinking behavior can be impacted by a number of factors, including polymer branching, molecular weight, and esterification of molecular groups containing unsaturated bonds.\n[9] In addition, DA is \na known antioxidant, and the increased content in polymer 4 may inhibit the efficiency of radical propagation in a more sig-\nnificant manor than heightened MA integration.\n[10] Given the \napplication that we are interested in using this material with, \nthe UV crosslinking process occurs as a processing step, and \na higher energy requirement to crosslink is not an inhibitory \nfactor for selecting this particular polymer composition.\nSwelling test measurements indicated that all but one of the \npolymer compositions generated in this work swelled to over \n200% of their initial volume (Figure\xa02C). Because PEG, a very \nhydrophilic polymer, is a significant component of this polymer, a high degree of swelling is understood by its presence in the \npolymer chain, allowing water to penetrate and surround the'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/10.1002_adbi.202000046.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='hydrophilic polymer, is a significant component of this polymer, a high degree of swelling is understood by its presence in the \npolymer chain, allowing water to penetrate and surround the \npolymer network. Polymer 4, which possessed a relatively lower ratio of PEG than all other polymer compositions, dem-onstrated significantly lower swelling capacity as well, with no swelling observed. While the feed ratios indicate that polymer \n2 has a relatively lower PEG content than polymer 1, the final \nratios excluding CA are quite close between these two composi-tions. Differences in monomer feed ratios is likely to result in differences in chain branching and varying polymer fragments, \nsome of which are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Infor -\nmation. These differences can alter the overall properties of the \npolymers. Furthermore, swelling also relates to crosslinking behavior, which varied between the compositions. While for application as a soft tissue scaffold we require a material that \nretains its shape and precise dimensions, a bulking material \ncould be useful to a certain extent in applications such as car -\ndiac tissue engineering as it could ultimately help preserve the structure of the ventricle wall that experiences substantial thin-\nning after myocardial infarction.\nPolymers demonstrated rapid mass loss upon exposure to \nsolution, as uncrosslinked polymer chains are washed from the \nfilm (Figure\xa0 2D). Notable degradation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was observed after 1 d, following which degrada-tion slowed. Of the compositions assessed, only one, polymer \n1, continued to show a reduction in mass after a period of four \nweeks. For the other two selected compositions (polymers 3 and 4) insignificant degradation was observed after one week.\n2.3.

These energies were selected based on values near \nthe measured energies required to generate a solid film easily \nremovable from the mold.\nResults demonstrate that all of the polymer compositions \nproduced films with elastic properties (Figure 3). Like swelling \nratio and UV energy required to crosslink, significant dif -\nferences exist between polymers 1 and 2 in terms of elastic \nmodulus and ultimate tensile strength, despite having similari-ties in final feed composition. The difference in composition resulting in the different mechanical properties could be due to polymer chain branching occurring at different junctions \nand to varying extents, resulting in overall different mechan-\nical properties. Additionally, we observed that the UV energy required to generate a stable film is slightly different between these two polymers, indicating that polymer 1 crosslinks with less energy. This supports the idea that even though the compo-sition of these two polymers may be similar, the arrangement \nof polymer chains is likely different. Polymers 2–4 exhibited an \nelastic modulus closely matching the native rat myocardium, which is around 43\xa0 ±\xa09\xa0kPa in the long direction.\n[11] Elongation \nat break greatly surpassed the strain that one could expect phys-iologically in vivo, and therefore it and failure stress were not \nconsidered to be critical properties for selection of our polymer \ncomposition. These tests were performed in dry conditions.\nTests were also performed in wet conditions (submerged in \nPBS) for polymer 3 and revealed that elastic modulus remains \nunchanged but failure stress and elongation at break were significantly lower for the wet samples (Figure S3, Supporting \nInformation). The most important consideration for our appli-cation is the elastic modulus, since the elongation at break is \nwell beyond the physiologically relevant values—physiologic \nstrain regime of 15–20% in applications such as cardiac tissue engineering.\n[12] Furthermore, given that swelling of the samples \ntakes place in solution and sample area is involved in the meas-urements, assessment in dry condition is preferred to ensure \naccuracy.\nPolymer 4, with an elastic modulus of 51.4\xa0 ±\xa04.1\xa0kPa, exhib-\nited favorable mechanical properties for soft tissue applica-\ntion, swelling properties, and a high content of the molecule \nintended to impact adhesive properties. Based on this, this par -\nticular polymer composition was assessed further for adhesive \nproperties. This selected polymer composition will be referred to as the AP polymer going forward.\n2.4. Adhesive Properties\nThe adhesive properties of crosslinked AP polymer films with \n40\xa0 wt% porogen prior to leaching were assessed. Porogen was added to impart a nanoporous structure according to pre-\nvious work.\n[11,13] Porogen concentrations within the range of \nprevious work (i.e., 20 to 60\xa0 wt%) were attempted and a final \nporogen concentration of 40\xa0 wt% was selected based on ease \nof perfusion into the molds while maintaining a high polymer \ncontent. The polymer samples were affixed to cardiac tissue \nFigure 2. Physical characterization of crosslinked polymers. A) Crosslinked polymer film (scale bar\xa0 =\xa05\xa0mm).

KGaA, Weinheimand adhesive strength was assessed in a pull-off test wherein \ntissue samples placed onto polymer films were pulled apart at a constant rate (Figure 4A and Figure S4, Supporting Informa-\ntion). The AP polymer film was compared with a crosslinked film comprised of poly(octamethylene maleate (anhydride) cit-rate) (POMaC), a commonly used citric acid polymer used as a material for many soft tissues such as blood vessels\n[13] and \ncardiac patches,[11] which was applied to the heart here with \nthe addition of fibrin glue. The adhesive strength of the AP polymer, oxidized with sodium periodate, was found to be \n0.44\xa0 ±\xa00.14\xa0N\xa0cm\n−2 (Figure\xa04C,D). This is 3.7 times greater than \nthe measured adhesive strength of POMaC films and 2.6 times \ngreater than that of fibrin glue on POMaC films. The fibrin \nglue administered on top of the POMaC film had an adhesive \nstrength of 0.17\xa0 ±\xa00.08\xa0N\xa0cm−2.\nPatches comprised of POMaC and AP polymer were fab-\nricated according to previous work.[11] These patches were \nplaced on the surface of rat hearts and the AP polymer patch was sprayed with a solution of sodium periodate, then washed vigorously with PBS to evaluate adhesion to the tissue in the \npresence of external force in a wet environment. The POMaC \npatch moved from its original placement position while the AP polymer patch remained affixed to the tissue, demonstrating improved adhesive capabilities to the heart surface (Figure S5 and Movies S1 and S2, Supporting Information).\n2.5. Cytotoxicity Assessment\nEvaluation of the leachable fraction of polymers using an lactate \ndehydrogenase (LDH) assay did not demonstrate cytotoxicity relative to the blank control (Figure 5A). Each composition \nevaluated behaved similarly in this respect, with insignifi-cant measurements of cell death. Visible confirmation of cell viability after exposure to media containing polymer leachable fraction was evident (Figure\xa05B). Cardiac fibroblasts were used \nhere, as an example of a cell abundant in this soft tissue. It was \nestimated that over 50% of cells in the heart are cardiac fibro-blasts.\n[14] In addition, fibroblasts are present in many soft tis-\nsues that the AP patch could be used for.\n2.6. Fabrication of a Scaffold with Distinct Adhesive and \nNonadhesive Domains\nA novel patch design was used to generate polydimethylsi-\nloxane (PDMS) molds and then polymer patches (Figure 6A). \nThe polymer patch included a center section with an accor -\ndion-like honeycomb mesh design, which is favorable for the culture and formation of physiologically relevant car -\ndiac tissue\n[12] and two outer sections for adhesion. Photo-\nlithography and soft lithography were used to generate the PDMS mold (Figure\xa06B) with 50\xa0 µm wide struts (Figure\xa06C). \nPOMaC was perfused into the top center section, and AP polymer with porogen was perfused into both sides of the PDMS mold (Figure\xa06D). After UV crosslinking, the resulting patch (Figure\xa06E), composed of both polymers, was removed \nfrom the mold and manually manipulated. The scaffold mesh \nsection adequately resembled the PDMS mold, and the inte-gration of the two polymers, which is required for formation of a uniform patch, was accomplished here (Figure S6, Sup-porting Information).\nFigure 3.

KGaA, Weinheim3. Discussion\nIn this work, polymers were synthesized for use as an elastic \nbiomaterial with a spatially varying adhesive design. To achieve the objective of generating a suitable polymer composition for \nthis application, several key criteria were upheld. Specifically, \nthe polymer should include a molecule capable of imparting adhesive properties, it should exist as a liquid that can be molded into a patch and crosslinked, and once crosslinked, it \nshould possess physiologically relevant elastomeric properties. \nSeveral synthesis conditions for the reaction of four monomers were used and one particular condition resulted in a material that satisfactorily met our requirements. This material was then assessed for its ability to adhere to a tissue.\nA polymer composition, polymer 4 or AP polymer, was \nfound to be a favorable composition for cardiac patch applica-tions. Possible fragments containing various junctions between monomers that, together, comprise the polymer and contribute to its overall properties are indicated (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The AP polymer possessed relatively high con-\ntent of the catechol molecule intended to impart adhesiveness. \nThe presence of vinyl groups to impart photocrosslinkability, a necessary feature for formation into patch shapes using microfabrication techniques, was confirmed through chemical characterization. A low swelling ratio was also achieved, which is favorable for formation into a patch to be used in wet envi-ronments. We expect that the rapid initial mass loss occurs due to the uncrosslinked material leaching out initially. As shown in Figure\xa02D, the mass loss that occurs over 7 and 28\xa0d is sub-\nstantially lower. Specifically, for polymer composition 4, AP \npolymer, the mass loss following the first 24\xa0h does not signifi-cantly increase. Due to this and the sterilization step required before use with cells or in vivo work, a leaching step in sol-\nvents (PBS followed by 70% ethanol for sterilization) is under -\ntaken, which should ensure that any uncrosslinked polymer is \nremoved and that the remaining polymer is stable for use as a patch.\nThe elastic properties of this material were demonstrated \nto be in a relevant range for cardiac tissue applications where \ncyclic contraction takes place. Specifically, the AP polymer film \ndemonstrated an elastic modulus very close to rat myocardium, an example of a soft tissue. Furthermore, its modulus is com-parable to the injectable cardiac patch we described in recent work with an elastic modulus of 69.3\xa0 ±\xa0 17 .4\xa0 kPa (x direction) \nand 14.7\xa0 ±\xa01.56\xa0kPa (y direction).\n[11] Thus, this polymer composi-\ntion is favorable for the future cardiac patch application.\nThe oxidized polymer film fabricated in this work dem-\nonstrated higher adhesive strength in pull-off tests than the \nFigure 4.

KGaA, Weinheimmaterial currently used by our group for cardiac tissue patches, \nPOMaC, and POMaC with the addition of fibrin glue. While the value of the adhesive strength reported is lower than some \nreported in literature, it is important to note that our patch \ndemonstrates 2.6 times greater adhesive strength than the materials that are currently used to adhere patches to tissue surfaces (i.e., fibrin glue). A notable difference between other \nadhesive strength analyses reported in literature is the method \nof testing. While a lap-shear adhesive test is sometimes per -\nformed, the pull-off test of adhesive strength, which was used in this report, is another option, but may result in different adhe-sive strength outcomes. For example, Lang et\xa0al. demonstrated \nadhesive strengths in the range of ≈0.5–2\xa0N\xa0cm\n−2 for their sur -\ngical glue when tested in a similar pull-off adhesion testing and \nthis material was considered a successful glue option for sur -\ngical applications.[3] It is important to note that their analysis \nof commercially available fibrin glue (TissuSeal) demonstrated an adhesive strength in a similar range to our report, below \n1\xa0N\xa0cm\n−2. The relative improvement in adhesive strength from \nour controls is more important than the exact adhesive strength \ngiven the differences in experimental analysis. The fibrin adhe-\nsive concentrations used in our experiment were the same \nas that used in recent work to attach a cardiac patch[11] and is \ntherefore used as a standard with which to compare our new adhesive polymer. Furthermore, the oxidized AP polymer patch performed better as an adhesive cardiac patch when compared to a POMaC control upon an in vivo application.\nThe enhanced adhesion of the oxidized AP polymer is \nexpected due to the ability of catechol groups to bind with tissue in a number of ways. Adhesion of catechols can occur through metal complexation and hydrogen bonding. Further -\nmore, when oxidized to the quinone form, using an oxidizing \nagent such as sodium periodate, reactions can occur with func-\ntional groups present on biological surfaces ( \ue0c6NH\n2, \ue0c6SH, \n\ue0c6OH, and \ue0c6COOH) through Schiff base reactions and Michael \naddition reactions, or alternatively, quinones can form free \nradicals which are then able to crosslink to other groups in the \npolymer.[4,8,15]\nThe improved adhesion we measured for our polymer \nfilm is promising. Many bioadhesive glues have been devel-oped that utilize the mussel inspired DOPA/DA chemistry. \nNotably, a film composed of rose bengal-chitosan, blended \nwith l-DOPA to impart adhesion when activated with a pho-\ntosensitizer and green light, was developed as a tissue support patch in surgical applications.\n[16] While this work involved \nsimple synthesis procedures in a favorable approach, the chitosan film is suitable for some, but not all applications. In particular, one area that we focus on is the use in cardiac \ntissue engineering and this is the application for which our \nmechanical properties were tailored. The synthesis steps involved in generating our polymers allow for the tuning of the mechanical properties of the patch. While chitosan film has many favorable properties as a biomaterial patch such as \nbiodegradability, flexibility, and porosity,\n[17] synthetic polymers \ndo offer some advantages for certain applications such as \nreduced batch-to-batch variability and increased control over \nphysical properties and degradation rates.[18] Furthermore, to \nthe best of our knowledge, no other scaffold materials that \nutilize the DOPA/DA chemistry for adhesion to tissue in a spatially prescribed way currently exists. The addition of a photocrosslinkable molecule allows us to fabricate the mate-rial into a patch form easily. It also opens up the option of using this material as a photocrosslinkable bioadhesive glue.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/10.1002_adbi.202000046.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Evaluation of the leachable fraction of polymers did not dem-\nonstrate cytotoxicity relative to the blank control. Future tests should include cytotoxicity analysis and in vivo biocompatibility assessments of polymer films adhered in the presence of the oxidizing agent. For applications such as cardiac patch tech-\nnology, the patch should remain intact long enough to provide \nstructural support after a heart attack, and thus a material that does not fully degrade over the long term, like our AP polymer, is favorable. Long-term biocompatibility assessments should be performed on this work going forward to ensure this material \nis adequate and safe for this purpose.\nSimilar materials have been shown to demonstrate low cyto-\ntoxicity and have also been used in vivo with degradation and \nabsorption without significant inflammatory response.\n[8] Based \non work using similar synthesis methods and composition (i.e., PEG, DA, citric acid), we expect that the degradation prod-\nucts of our material will not demonstrate significant cytotox-\nicity and that cell proliferation and morphological assessment would demonstrate viability.\n[8,19] Moreover, in vivo experiments \nwith materials containing these similar components indi-cated improved wound healing\n[8,19] and minimal inflammatory \nresponse.[8,20] Our own previous published work using poly-\nmers containing the other similar components (i.e., MA, citric acid) indicate biocompatibility.\n[11,21]\nIn terms of the oxidizing agent, sodium periodate, numerous \npapers report its use in similar approaches.[8,20,22,23] In vivo \nexperiments using a polymer with 8\xa0wt% sodium (meta) peri-odate indicated that only minor acute inflammation resulted \nand improved wound healing of the wounds treated with this \napproach.\n[8] It is reasonable to expect that in small concentra-\ntions, this oxidizing agent will not cause issues of cytotoxicity given that in the oxidation reaction of DA, electrons will be \nconsumed by the periodate ion, forming the reduction product \niodate ion (IO\n3−), which can be again reduced to the nontoxic \niodide ion (I−).[22,24]\nThe patch design established here is novel in two ways: 1) \na patch that contains both flaps for adhesion and sections designed to mimic soft tissue elasticity and where in future, \ncells could be grown and 2) a patch that integrates two dis-\ntinct polymers through perfusion into microfabricated molds and integrated by photocrosslinking. The stability of the patch during manual manipulation indicates that both polymers were adequately crosslinked within and between themselves. This demonstrates that this is a realistic fabrication approach to con-\ntinue using in future experiments.\nA related cardiac patch design from previous reports pos-\nsessed a scaffold and flap sections to aid in the culturing of \ntissues around the scaffold in a custom-designed bioreactor.\n[11] \nThis design was used for different elastomeric polymers and viable, beating cardiac tissue around the scaffold mesh between \npolymer flaps was established in both cases.\n[9,11] However, these \npatches lacked adhesive capability, leading to the development \nof the novel design reported here. Another cardiac patch com-\nprised of a distinct center region to impart a given function—in \nthat case, conductivity—was developed by Mawad et\xa0al.[25] This \nAdv.

Here, we strived to generate a patch that also possesses \ndistinct regions, but with a focus on achieving desired mechan-ical properties and a center mesh scaffold. An anticipated future direction is to use our dual-component adhesive patch \nto culture cardiac tissue around the scaffold mesh while main-\ntaining the AP polymer flaps for use to secure the entire system to the tissue surface. It is important to note that selection of a polymer for the center mesh section can be made to support culture of specific cell types, such as POMaC for culture of car -\ndiac tissue. In vivo assessment will be required in future work to evaluate its efficacy and effect on cardiac function.\n4. Conclusion\nA novel polymer was synthesized to possess photocrosslinking capability, elastic properties matching cardiac tissue, and a mol-ecule to impart adhesive capability. Based on assessments of \npolymer chemical and physical properties, a favorable adhesive \npatch polymer composition was selected and used in evalua-tions of adhesive strength. The AP polymer in oxidized form \nachieved greater adhesive strength to cardiac tissue than pre-\nviously used cardiac patch polymers and fibrin glue, as an example of soft tissue application. Finally, the AP polymer was used in the fabrication of a dual-component patch containing \nadhesive polymer flaps and scaffold mesh sections, resembling \nthe familiar Band-Aid. This novel design is tailored toward use as a cardiac tissue patch that can adhere to the outer surface of the epicardium, with the goal of replacing the need for addi-tional glue and sutures. In future studies, this material and \npatch design can be incorporated into future iterations of car -\ndiac patches, or biomaterial patches in general, aimed to sup-\nport or regenerate damaged tissue.\n5. Experimental Section\nMaterials: Polyethylene glycol (M n\xa0=\xa0 400\xa0 g\xa0 mol−1), MA, citric acid, \nDA hydrochloride, 1,8-octanediol (OD), 1,4-dioxane, chloroform-d, \n2-hydroxy-4′ -(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (Irgacure 2959), \npoly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDM, M n\xa0≈\xa0500), thrombin from \nbovine plasma, fibrinogen from bovine plasma, and sodium (meta)periodate were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por Dialysis Membrane molecular weight cut-off 1000) was purchased from Thomas Scientific (Swedesboro, NJ). PDMS (Sylgard 184) was purchased from Dow Chemical (Midland, MI). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N -2-\nethane sulfonic acid (HEPES), GlutaMax supplement, and Dulbecco’s PBS were purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). LDH assay was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). All materials were used as received unless otherwise described.\nPrepolymer Synthesis: Polymers were first synthesized by reacting PEG \n(M\nn\xa0=\xa0 400\xa0 g\xa0 mol−1), MA, CA, and DA hydrochloride. The molar ratios \nof monomers are detailed in Table\xa0 1. CA, PEG, and MA were added to a 250\xa0 mL triple-neck flask and heated to 140\xa0 °C. At 5\xa0 min, DA was \nadded and the reaction was maintained under nitrogen for the entire duration. The reaction was continued for a set time, at which point the prepolymer was dissolved in 50\xa0mL deionized water and dialyzed for 1\xa0d. Snap-freezing and 3\xa0 d of lyophilization were performed to obtain the purified prepolymer solution.\nFor comparison, POMaC was similarly prepared.\n[11,13,26,27] POMaC was'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/10.1002_adbi.202000046.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='For comparison, POMaC was similarly prepared.\n[11,13,26,27] POMaC was \nsynthesized through a polycondensation reaction of OD, MA, and CA. An equimolar amount of carboxylic acid groups to hydroxyl groups was maintained and a molar ratio of CA to MA was kept at 1:4. The reactants were added to a 250\xa0 mL triple-neck flask and the reaction vessel was heated at high temperature until the reactants were melted. The vessel was transferred to an oil bath where the sample was held at temperature of 140\xa0 °C and under nitrogen purge for 3\xa0 h. The prepolymer was \ndissolved in 1,4-dioxane and purified by drop-precipitation into deionized water, followed by drying under air flow.\nChemical Characterization: Prepolymer samples were characterized \nusing attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) (Perkin Elmer Spectrum One). 32 scans were taken from 4000 to 550\xa0 cm\n−1 at a resolution of \n4\xa0cm−1. Corrections for ATR, baseline, and smoothing were performed. \nThe prepolymer properties were analyzed for the material and a drop of the prepolymer was used to cover the entire ATR-FTIR probe. While there is a penetration depth limitation, any differences are not expected in the bulk properties compared to the surface properties of a well-mixed polymer gel. The dissolved polymer material was also characterized by UV–vis and \n1H NMR to elucidate the chemical composition further.\nUV-visible spectroscopy (Lambda 25 UV/Vis Spectrometer) was used \nto determine the presence of DA in the prepolymers. All prepolymers were dissolved at 0.125\xa0mg\xa0mL\n−1 in water except for POMaC prepolymers \nwhich were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane and spectra measured across a wavelength of 200–700\xa0nm.\n1H NMR (Agilent DD2 600\xa0 MHz spectrometer) was performed \nto confirm polymer structure. Prepolymer samples were dissolved at 10\xa0 mg\xa0 mL\n−1 in deuterated chloroform and chemical shifts were tested \nagainst the resonance of protons in tetramethylsilane. Integration of peaks associated with specific protons in the monomers based on predictive software (CambridgeSoft ChemDraw Ultra) was performed to assess compositional ratios of the monomers within the prepolymers (PEG: 4.16–4.42\xa0ppm, MA: 6.35–6.58\xa0ppm, DA: 6.61–6.91\xa0ppm). CA did not have distinct peaks and was therefore not assessed.\nFilm Sample Preparation: To generate crosslinked polymer films, \n5\xa0 wt% PI, Irgacure 2959, was added to the prepolymer to generate a prepolymer–PI mixture. In specified cases, 40\xa0wt% PEGDM was added to act as a porogen, resulting in a prepolymer–PI–porogen mixture. The mixtures were stored at 4\xa0 °C under nitrogen in the dark. The prepolymer \nmixtures were perfused into custom molds fabricated by generating PDMS negatives from 3D-printed molds and assembling the PDMS molds onto glass slides. Molds of the following 3D were used: 1) 6\xa0mm diameter by 0.3\xa0mm thick circular discs, 2) 10\xa0mm diameter by 0.3\xa0mm thick circular discs, and 3) 10 by 4 by 0.3\xa0 mm rectangle strips. Once perfused with prepolymer mixtures, the filled molds were exposed to UV light. The PDMS molds were removed from the glass and the film sample was placed in PBS for 15\xa0min to wash out porogen and PI and to facilitate removal of the sample from the glass slide.\nPhysical Characterization: The prepolymer–PI mixtures described \nabove were perfused into 6\xa0 mm diameter, 0.3\xa0 mm thick PDMS molds assembled on glass slides. Samples were exposed to varying amounts of UV energy and the minimum energy required to generate a solid film that could be peeled off the glass and remain intact was assessed.\nSwelling tests were performed on polymer strips, exposed to \nUV energy (2500 or 7200\xa0 mJ\xa0 cm\n−2), and cut into rectangles of \n2.5\xa0mm\xa0 ×\xa04\xa0mm\xa0 ×\xa00.3\xa0mm.

Custom-designed 3D printed \nsample holders affixed to the Myograph (Kent Scientific) were used to hold samples at a starting distance of 1.000\xa0 mm apart. Samples were placed onto a layer of double-sided tape on the sample holder and subsequently affixed with epoxy glue (Fast Setting Epoxy, Permatex). Care was taken to ensure that the epoxy was spread thinly and did not contact the section of the polymer to be stretched. The procedure outlined in previous work\n[11,28] was carried out to evaluate the mechanical \nproperties of the samples. Briefly, the sample holders affixed to the Myograph with polymer strip samples attached were separated at a strain rate of ≈1\xa0mm\xa0min\n−1 until material failure. Force transducer and \ndisplacement readings were recorded and converted into values of strain and engineering stress, from which Young’s Modulus was determined. For assessment in wet conditions, samples fixed onto the holders were submerged in PBS for 5\xa0min prior to testing.\nAdhesive Tests: Five adult female Sprague–Dawley rats were humanely \neuthanized according to a protocol approved by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee. Rat hearts were extracted, washed with PBS, and placed in a rat heart slicer with 1\xa0mm coronal slice intervals. Slices were made on the four outer sides of the heart using a razor blade to create 2\xa0 mm thick tissue samples. A 6\xa0 mm diameter bore was subsequently used to cut tissue slices into small circular samples. Extracted tissue samples were kept in PBS at 4\xa0 °C and prior to testing, \ntissue samples were maintained at room temperature on PBS soaked gauze for at least 15\xa0min.\nA modified method based on the ASTM standard test for the \nassessment of strength properties of tissue adhesives in tension (F2258-05(2015)) was employed. The grip size was reduced based on the distinct characteristics of the material\n[3] and custom-designed holders were 3D \nprinted and used for securing the polymer and tissue samples. Tissue samples were glued onto the tissue holder using cyanoacrylate glue. Although cyanoacrylate glues have strong adhesion properties, they have toxic degradation products, are brittle and solidify in the presence of water, and result in inflammatory response and tissue necrosis,\n[7,29] eliminating \nthem as a desirable option for in vivo applications.\nThe prepolymer–PI–porogen mixture was perfused into 10\xa0 mm \ndiameter PDMS molds described previously and exposed to 7200\xa0mJ\xa0cm−2 \nUV energy. The polymer film disc was soaked in PBS and placed on a bottom sample holder with the use of double-sided tape. A top sample holder was screwed on top to further secure the polymer sample. The polymer-containing holder was then placed into the equipment grips and the tissue sample was placed on top and fastened into the grips.\nThree sample conditions were evaluated. For testing of the DA \npolymer, prior to placement of the tissue sample to the polymer sample, 5\xa0µL of 4.8\xa0 wt% sodium (meta)periodate, a common oxidizing agent, \nin distilled water was pipetted onto the polymer and left for 1\xa0 min before the tissue sample was attached (Figure\xa04A). Control samples of POMaC film (Figure S4A, Supporting Information) and POMaC film with fibrin glue (Figure S4B, Supporting Information) were also evaluated. Customized fibrin glue was generated by combining 110.5\xa0 mg\xa0 mL\n−1'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/10.1002_adbi.202000046.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='−1 \nfibrinogen and 500\xa0IU\xa0mL−1 thrombin with the gelation time of 5–10\xa0s. \nOne drop of fibrinogen was applied through a 25-gauge needle onto the polymer followed by one drop of thrombin. After 30\xa0 s, tissue samples were placed on top of the gel.\nTissue samples in holders were placed securely onto polymer samples \nin holders for 10\xa0 min prior to separation. Samples whose placement shifted in the grips were discarded resulting in sample sizes of three or four for each condition. For each test, the samples were separated at a crosshead speed of 2\xa0 mm\xa0 min\n−1. The maximum initial load sustained \nwas recorded and divided by the bond area to find the adhesive strength.\nPolymer material adhesion to heart tissue was also assessed in vivo. \nScaffold molds were fabricated according to previous work.[11] POMaC and \nAP polymers containing PI and porogen were perfused into each mold to generate scaffolds composed of each polymer for application to the heart. All procedures were performed according to a protocol approved by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee. Adult Lewis rats (≈ 250\xa0g, \nCharles River, USA) were selected and assigned randomly an AP polymer or POMaC scaffold. The animals were anesthetized by isofluorane inhalation (3% v/v) and after thoracotomy a scaffold was placed over the left ventricle with tweezers, followed by administration of a sodium periodate solution (8\xa0 wt% in ddH\n2O) to oxidize the scaffold material. \nThis was followed by the vigorous administration of PBS (≈ 1\xa0mL) to the \nheart surface in attempt to dislodge the scaffold.\nCytotoxicity: Fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of one litter of \nten neonatal rats according to previous reports[26] and seeded in a 12 well \nplate at a density of 100\xa0000 cells per well. Prepolymer–PI mixtures were perfused in 6\xa0mm diameter molds described previously and crosslinked with 8000\xa0mJ\xa0cm\n−2 UV energy. Samples were removed from the molds \nand soaked in PBS for 3\xa0h, soaked in 70% ethanol overnight to sterilize, and then washed in PBS for at least 3\xa0h. Polymer samples were placed into 12-well plates with 5\xa0mL phenol red-free DMEM containing glucose (4.5\xa0 g\xa0 L\n−1), 10% v/v FBS, 1% v/v HEPES buffer, 1% v/v GlutaMAX-I, \nand 1% v/v penicillin–streptomycin and incubated at 37\xa0 °C for 24\xa0 h. \nConditioned media, 1\xa0mL, was then used to culture cells. After 24\xa0h, cells were imaged and media was removed for viability assessment using an LDH assay.\nPatch Design and Fabrication: A patch was designed using AutoCAD \nsoftware. Standard SU-8 photolithography techniques were used to fabricate the silicon wafer. Laser printer generator (Heidelberg uPG 501) was used to generate a chrome photomask with the desired pattern from a computer-aided design. SU-8 photoresist was spin-coated on a silicon wafer according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for a 45\xa0 µm-thick \nfilm and subsequently exposed to 365\xa0 nm UV using a mask aligner (OAI model 30), through the chrome photomask. Pre-exposure bakes and postexposure bakes were performed according to manufacturer’s guidelines. The silicon wafer was submersed in SU-8 developer solution to dissolve the unexposed photoresist. A negative PDMS mold was created pouring PDMS elastomer and curing agent (1:10 ratio) over the wafer, degassing, and baking for 1\xa0h at 80\xa0 °C. POMaC with 5\xa0wt% Irgacure \n2959 and AP polymer with 40\xa0wt% PEGDM and 5\xa0wt% Irgacure 2959 were perfused into the mold in separate inlet channels and allowed to exit from outlet channels to generate a two-component patch. Molds containing the polymer mixtures were exposed to 7200\xa0mJ\xa0cm\n−2 UV light. The PDMS was \nremoved from the glass and the film sample was placed in PBS for 15\xa0min. Images were obtained using optical microscopy (Olympus CKX41).\nStatistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad \nPrism 8.0 software.
