Nevertheless, the insufficient density and specificity of receptors of tumor cells still \nlimits the efficiency of tumor-targeting \nproperty.\n[3] Upregulating the number of \nexisting targets or producing the expres-sion of novel targets is a promising \nstrategy to address the limitations of these \nconventional tumor-targeting approaches. As a well-accepted target in cancer therapy, phosphatidylserine (PS), normally locating \nin the inner cell membrane of normal \ncells, translocates to the surface of apoptotic cells,\n[4] and its \nexpression can further be elevated as a response to enhanced \napoptosis during the cancer therapy. Therefore, the apoptosis-dependent PS level provides a chance to improve the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles and results in the enhancement of tumor theranostics.\n[5] To realize effective tumor imaging \nand therapy simultaneously, organic nanoparticles[6] and iron \noxide nanoparticle-based hybrid platforms[7] have been widely Nanomedicine has significantly impacted cancer theranostics.

Recently, photothermal therapy has attracted great \ninterest in the field of cancer therapy due to a minimal attenu-ation of the energy and undesirable thermal damage to healthy \ntissue. Many novel nanoparticulate photothermal therapies \nhave already been developed.\n[8]\nAccording to the above principle, our strategy is to \nupregulate the apoptosis degree of tumor by an anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX)\n[9] and thus to increase the level of phosphati-\ndylserine (PS) in the tumor. The upregulated PS is leveraged as the receptor to improve the targeting efficacy of apoptosis \nhoming nanoparticles. Drug-induced PS have been generally \nused as biomarkers for apoptosis,\n[10] however, to the best of our \nknowledge, this strategy has never been used to amplify the effi-ciency of tumor theranostics. Herein, we constructed zinc(II) \ndipicolylamine (ZnDPA) conjugated Fe@Fe\n3O4 NPs (MNPs/\nZnDPA), in which ZnDPA exhibits the high affinity with PS[11] \nand Fe@Fe 3O4 NPs presents the high transverse relaxation.[12] \nAs a proof of concept, their amplification of the accumulation \nof MNPs/ZnDPA, MR signal, and photothermal therapy for tumor in vivo were investigated in detail on the apoptotic 4T1 \nxenograft models with the different levels of PS expression.\n2. Results and Discussion\n2.1. Synthesis and Characterizations of MNPs/ZnDPA\nFe@Fe 3O4 nanoparticles (MNPs) were prepared and char -\nacterized according to our previous report (Figure S1, Sup-\nporting Information).[12b] The MNPs were then modified with PEG-phospholipid and DBCO-phospholipid (w/w, 8:2) by self-assembly to form DBCO-functionalized MNPs (MNPs/DBCO). Through strain-promoted click reaction,\n[13] MNPs/DBCO was \nconjugated with zinc(II) N,N-bis(2-picolyl-2-azidoethyl)amine (ZnDPA-N\n3) to form ZnDPA-modified MNPs (MNPs/ZnDPA, \nScheme 1). For the following control experiment, PEGylated'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/papers/10.1002_adhm.201800296.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Scheme 1). For the following control experiment, PEGylated \nMNPs (MNPs/PEG) were synthesized with only PEG-phos-\npholipids (Figure S2, Supporting Information). To confirm \nthe successful conjugation of ZnDPA on the surface of MNPs, we used matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF-MS) to characterize the \nstrain-promoted click reaction between DSPE-PEG\n2000-DBCO \nand ZnDPA-N 3. The results indicated that the molecular weight \nof the product was increased to ≈3524.6 Da, which was resulted \nfrom the formation of DSPE-PEG 2000-ZnDPA (Figure S3, Sup-\nporting Information). As shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1A,B), the average diam-\neter of MNPs/ZnDPA was 13.0 ± 1.2 nm. The hydrodynamic \ndiameter (HD) was determined to be ≈36.5 nm (Figure 1C). \nMNPs/ZnDPA displayed the excellent colloidal stability within half a month in both water and saline solution confirmed by their unchanged HDs, which provided great potential for the biomedical application (Figure 1D).\n2.2. Targeting Property of MNPs/ZnDPA In Vitro\nBefore the application of MNPs/ZnDPA in vivo, the in vitro \ncytotoxicity was investigated on 4T1 (tumor cell) and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) (normal cell) \nAdv.

The cell viability was higher than ≈ 90% with the concentration up to 200 µ g mL\n−1 \nafter 24 h incubation, indicating their low cytotoxicity of MNPs/ZnDPA. Considering the high transverse relaxation of Fe@\nFe\n3O4 NPs,[12b] to evaluate the apoptosis-targeted property \nof MNPs/ZnDPA, we measured the T 2 values by a 0.5 T MR \nsystem for normal and apoptotic 4T1 cells induced by DOX \n(5 µg mL−1, 4 h), which were both incubated with MNPs/\nZnDPA (100 µg mL−1) for 2 h, respectively. After the incubation, \nthe apoptotic 4T1 cells showed significant higher Δ T2/T2 value \n(≈88%) than that of normal 4T1 cells (≈ 71%) (Figure 2A). Com-\npared to that of normal 4T1 cells, the amplification of MR signal \nin apoptotic 4T1 cells should be attributed to the specific inter -\naction between PS outside the cell membrane of apoptotic 4T1 \ncells and ZnDPA on the surface of MNPs.[11b] However, in the \nblock group, the Δ T2/T2 value of apoptotic 4T1 cells decreased to \n≈75%. The MR imaging results in vitro suggested that MNPs/\nZnDPA can specifically amplify T 2-weighted MR signal through \nZnDPA-mediated cellular binding in apoptotic tumor cells.\nTo verify the apoptosis-targeted property of MNPs/ZnDPA, \nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was labeled on the surface of MNPs (named as MNPs/FITC/ZnDPA, Figure S4, Supporting Information), and was subsequently imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As observed by CLSM, after \napoptotic 4T1 cells incubation with MNPs/FITC/ZnDPA \n(100 µg mL\n−1), compared to the normal and block group, the'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/papers/10.1002_adhm.201800296.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='(100 µg mL\n−1), compared to the normal and block group, the \nmore intense of green fluorescence signal in apoptotic group was generated from attached MNPs/FITC/ZnDPA, while red fluorescence signal was originated from DOX. The fluo-rescence of DOX in all three groups (apoptotic group, target group, and block group) was set as an internal standard to conduct a quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity. \nAs shown in Figure 2B,C, apoptotic 4T1 cells only showed rela-\ntive low green fluorescence signal. The fluorescence intensity ratio of green channel to red channel was only ≈0.30. In sharp contrast, after apoptotic 4T1 cells were incubated with MNPs/\nFITC/ZnDPA, a strong green fluorescence signal was observed. \nTherefore, the fluorescence intensity ratio of green channel to red channel increased to ≈0.94, which was ≈3 times higher than that of apoptotic 4T1 cells. The enhanced green fluorescence was attributed to the improved accumulation of MNPs/FITC/\nZnDPA in apoptotic cells. Whereas, in the block group, the flu-\norescence intensity ratio of green channel to red channel was ≈0.42, indicating ZnDPA inhibited the PS binding with MNPs/FITC/ZnDPA.

However, for normal tumor group, almost no change \nof MR image in the tumor was observed, remaining a T/M ratio of ≈1.4 of T\n2 values from preinjection to 10 h postinjection. All \nthe data demonstrated the preferred amplifying apoptosis-tar -\ngeted effect of MNPs/ZnDPA in tumor with an increasing level of PS expression.\n2.5. Amplifying Apoptosis-Targeted Photothermal Imaging (PTI) \nIn Vivo\nBased on the good amplifying apoptosis-homing property of \nMNPs/ZnDPA for apoptotic II group and high photothermal conversion property of MNPs/ZnDPA,\n[12b] we chose the \napoptotic II xenograft tumor as a model to evaluate ampli-fying apoptosis-targeted property in vivo by the photothermal imaging. Apoptotic 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were divided into five groups. The tempera-ture of tumors under the laser irradiation (808 nm, 0.5 W cm\n−2, 5 min) was shown \nin Figure S8 (Supporting Information). In group a (Laser group), the temperature of \ntumor increased only ≈2.2 °C under the \nlaser irradiation. To investigate the apoptotic-\ntargeting property of nanoparticles, groups b and c were designed. In group b (MNPs/\nPEG + Laser group), which was a control \ngroup of the apoptosis-targeting PTI group, \nthe EPR effect of MNPs/PEG resulted in the enrichment of MNPs/PEG in tumor, and the temperature of tumor increased ≈3.6 °C. As \nthe apoptosis-targeting PTI group (MNPs/ZnDPA + Laser group), the temperature of \ntumor increased ≈4.8 °C, which was resulted \nfrom the combination of the EPR effect \nand apoptosis-targeting property of MNPs/\nZnDPA. To further investigate the amplifying apoptosis-targeting property of nanoparti-cles, followed by the first PTI, MNPs/PEG'), Document(metadata={'source': 'papers/papers/10.1002_adhm.201800296.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='(group d) and MNPs/ZnDPA (group e) were \ninjected for the second time plus the laser irra-diation, respectively. While the temperature of tumor in group d increased ≈6.1 °C under \nthe same laser irradiation, the temperature of tumor in group e increased ≈ 8.6 °C. Due to \nthe increased apoptotic degree of tumor and the amplifying apoptosis-targeting property \nof MNPs/ZnDPA, more nanoparticles were \nenriched in the apoptotic tumor and resulted in the highest temperature increasing in group e. The fact provided a great possibility for the amplifying tumor PTI in vivo.\n2.6. Amplifying Apoptosis-Targeted Photo-\nthermal Therapy In Vivo\nConsidering the better amplifying apoptosis-targeting property on the apoptotic II model, the amplifying apoptosis-targeting photothermal therapy was investigated on the apoptotic II model. The mice were devided into eight groups randomly. The \ntumor growth data were presented in Figure 4A–C. Tumors \nof group 1 (apoptosis group), group 2 (laser group), group 3 \n(MNPs/PEG group), and group 4 (MNPs/ZnDPA group) all exhibited no significant inhibition. The volume of tumor increased to ≈13-folds after 20 d. To investigate the apoptotic- targeting photothermal therapy of nanoparticles, groups 5 (MNPs/\nPEG + Laser group) and 6 (MNPs/ZnDPA + Laser group) were \ndone. While the volume of tumor in group 5 was an increase by  \n≈13-folds, the volume of tumor in group 6 was an increase \nby ≈9-folds, which was resulted from the good apoptosis-tar -\ngeting property of MNPs/ZnDPA.

The body weight after various treat-\nments showed negligible changes (Figure S9, Supporting Information), which indicated the low toxicity in vivo during the photothermal treatment.\n3. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we have successfully developed ZnDPA-conju-gated Fe@Fe\n3O4 NPs by the strain-promoted click chemistry. \nDue to the high affinity between ZnDPA and PS on the outer cell surface of apoptotic cancer cells, MNPs/ZnDPA exhibited \nthe excellent amplifying apoptosis-targeted MR imaging in \ntumor with the different apoptotic degree. Due to the ampli-fying apoptosis-targeted property in the tumor, MNPs/ZnDPA could be rendered as a nanotheranostic agent for enhanced pho-\ntothermal therapy in vivo. Our work provided a revolutionary \napproach to be an effective theranostic agent for the clinical transformation of Fe@Fe\n3O4 nanoparticles in the future. The \nstrategy will open up a new avenue in the field of in vivo tumor-\ntargeted theranostics.\n4.
