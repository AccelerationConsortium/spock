    "title": "History-agnostic battery degradation inference",
    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted widespread attention as an efficient energy storage device on electric vehicles (EV) to achieve emission-free mobility. However, the performance of LIBs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to quantify. Having accurate estimations of a battery\u2019s remaining life across different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying used batteries for second-life applications. Since the full history of a battery may not always be available in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that enables dynamic degradation rate prediction, including both short-term and long-term forecasting, while requiring only the most recent battery usage information. Specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series inputs, and predicts the near-term and \u2026",

    "title": "Clinical sequencing of the retinitis pigmentosa gene RPGR in over 1,000 cases of vision loss",
    "abstract": "RPGR pathogenic variants are the major cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we report the results from 1,033 clinical DNA tests that included sequencing of RPGR. A total of 184 RPGR variants were identified: 78 pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 14 uncertain, and 92 likely benign or benign. Among the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, 23 were novel, and most were frameshift or nonsense mutations (87%) and enriched (67%) in RPGR exon 15 (ORF15). Identical pathogenic variants found in different families were largely on different haplotype backgrounds, indicating relatively frequent, recurrent RPGR mutations. None of the 16 mother/affected son pairs showed de novo mutations; all 16 mothers were heterozygous for the pathogenic variant. These last two observations support the occurrence of most RPGR mutations in the male germline.",

    "title": "A data-driven framework to improve the wear resistance of a low-alloy steel fabricated by laser powder bed fusion",
    "abstract": "The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique provides an opportunity to precisely control process parameters and produce materials with desired microstructure, which play an important role in developing wear-resistance components. An accurate and efficient determination of the optimal process window for new materials, however, remains a highly sought yet challenging task due to a high experimental cost by trial and error. In this study, we demonstrate a physics-informed data-driven framework to create a 3D process map and optimize printing parameters (i.e., laser power (P), scan speed (v), and hatch distance (h)) for a newly designed low-alloy steel. First, we establish a highly precise P-v process map by thoroughly exploring kernel selection and parameter hyper-tuning in Gaussian process regression (GPR) models. Subsequently, we employ the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm with different \u2026",

    "title": "A public-private partnership that supports the discovery of new medicines through open access research.",
    "abstract": "EPB41L3 is, with moesin (MSN), a member of the FERM family, which is highly expressed in brain as well as in other tissues (kidney, intestine, and testis). Similar to MSN, it binds to the C-terminus of CD44 and transmits signals to the cytoskeleton. EPB41L3 is inversely correlated with markers of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). We have chosen to pursue the EPB41L3-CD44 interaction as a potential key driver in AD, and as a selectivity target for FERM proteins. This TEP includes expression constructs and methods for purification of the FERM domain from recombinant E. coli; Fluorescence-based assays for binding its ligand; a peptide from the cytoplasmic tail of CD44; crystal structures and a soakable crystallization system; and small molecules identified from a crystal-based fragment screen. We have also expressed several related FERM domains which can be used as a selectivity panel when developing new ligands. In follow-up work, we plan to expand the fragment hits to generate chemical tools for both EPB41L3 and moesin.",

    "title": "Flipping the script: understanding riboswitches from an alternative perspective",
    "abstract": "Riboswitches are broadly distributed regulatory elements most frequently found in the 5\u2032-leader sequence of bacterial mRNAs that regulate gene expression in response to the binding of a small molecule effector. The occupancy status of the ligand binding aptamer domain manipulates downstream information in the message that instructs the expression machinery. Currently, there are over 55 validated riboswitch classes, where each class is defined based on the identity of the ligand it binds and/or sequence and structure conservation patterns within the aptamer domain. This classification reflects an \u201captamer-centric\u201d perspective that dominates our understanding of riboswitches. In this review, we propose a conceptual framework that groups riboswitches based on the mechanism by which RNA manipulates information directly instructing the expression machinery. This scheme does not replace the established \u2026",
