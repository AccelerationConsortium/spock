A total of 184 RPGR variants were identified: 78 pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 14 uncertain, and 92 likely benign or benign. Among the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, 23 were novel, and most were frameshift or nonsense mutations (87%) and enriched (67%) in RPGR exon 15 (ORF15). Identical pathogenic variants found in different families were largely on different haplotype backgrounds, indicating relatively frequent, recurrent RPGR mutations. None of the 16 mother/affected son pairs showed de novo mutations; all 16 mothers were heterozygous for the pathogenic variant. These last two observations support the occurrence of most RPGR mutations in the male germline.",

Similar to MSN, it binds to the C-terminus of CD44 and transmits signals to the cytoskeleton. EPB41L3 is inversely correlated with markers of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). We have chosen to pursue the EPB41L3-CD44 interaction as a potential key driver in AD, and as a selectivity target for FERM proteins. This TEP includes expression constructs and methods for purification of the FERM domain from recombinant E. coli; Fluorescence-based assays for binding its ligand; a peptide from the cytoplasmic tail of CD44; crystal structures and a soakable crystallization system; and small molecules identified from a crystal-based fragment screen. We have also expressed several related FERM domains which can be used as a selectivity panel when developing new ligands. In follow-up work, we plan to expand the fragment hits to generate chemical tools for both EPB41L3 and moesin.",

This classification reflects an \u201captamer-centric\u201d perspective that dominates our understanding of riboswitches.

    "abstract": "Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a tiny subset can practically be made and tested for a given task. Of those, a mere handful will advance to the clinic or the market because of regulatory and economic factors, like Food and Drug Administration approval or Capital Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is slow, expensive, and high stakes; committing to the wrong chemical can ruin a clinical trial or doom a consumer device. Generative AI has undoubtedly broadened and accelerated the early stages of chemical design. However, real-world success takes place further downstream, where the impact of AI has been limited so far. Here, we identify the nature of this \u2018execution gap\u2019and analyze its technical and social sources with a focus on the domain-specific nuances that separate chemistry and materials from other applications of AI. We explore strategies to address the gap and include directions for algorithmic development, strategies for efficient creation and sharing of data, and maximization of feedback between early discovery and downstream validation. Like any powerful technology, generative AI in chemistry brings ethical concerns and dual-use risks. In our analysis, these are not as critical or immediate as they are in other applications of AI. Precisely because of the execution gap, AI has so far not meaningfully lowered the barrier for bad actors to produce chemicals known to be harmful and nor has AI creativity practically broadened the risk spectrum in terms of the types and severity of potential misuse.",

These two reactions rely on distinct catalyst properties that are difficult to achieve in a single catalyst. Here we report decoupling the CO2-to-C2+ reaction into two steps, CO2-to-CO and CO-to-C2+, by deploying two distinct catalyst layers operating in tandem to achieve the desired transformation. The first catalyst, atomically dispersed cobalt phthalocyanine, reduces CO2 to CO with high selectivity.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are having a transformative and accelerating impact on many if not most, technological domains. To shed light on these questions, the authors and participants gathered in person for the ASLLA Symposium on the theme of \u2018Accelerated Chemical Science with AI\u2019 at Gangneung, Republic of Korea. We present the findings, ideas, comments, and often contentious opinions expressed during four panel discussions related to the respective general topics: \u2018Data\u2019, \u2018New applications\u2019, \u2018Machine learning algorithms\u2019, and \u2018Education\u2019.

    "title": "Evaluating the feasibility of medium chain oleochemical synthesis using microbial chain elongation",
    "abstract": "Chain elongating bacteria are a unique guild of strictly anaerobic bacteria that have garnered interest for sustainable chemical manufacturing from carbon-rich wet and gaseous waste streams. They produce C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids which are valuable platform chemicals that can be used directly, or derivatized to service a wide range of chemical industries. However, the application of chain elongating bacteria for synthesizing products beyond C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids has not been evaluated. In this study, we assess the feasibility of expanding the product spectrum of chain elongating bacteria to C9-C12 fatty acids, along with the synthesis of C6 fatty alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, diols, and methyl ketones. We propose several metabolic engineering strategies to accomplish these conversions in chain elongating bacteria and utilize constraint-based metabolic modelling to predict pathway stoichiometries, assess thermodynamic feasibility, and estimate ATP and product yields. We also evaluate how producing alternative products impacts the growth rate of chain elongating bacteria via resource allocation modelling, revealing a trade-off between product carbon length and class versus cell growth rate. Together, these results highlight the potential for using chain elongating bacteria as a platform for diverse oleochemical biomanufacturing and offer a starting point for guiding future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at expanding their product range.",

    "title": "Ru-doped functional porous materials for electrocatalytic water splitting",
    "abstract": "Electrolytic water splitting (EWS) is an attractive and promising technique for the production of hydrogen energy. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetic rate of hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions leads to a high overpotential and low energy efficiency. Up to date, Pt/Ir-based nanocatalysts have become the state-of-the-art EWS catalysts, but disadvantages such as high cost and low earth abundance greatly limit their applications in EWS devices. As an attractive candidate for the Pt/Ir catalysts, series of Ru-based nanomaterials have aroused much attention for their low price, Pt-like hydrogen bond strength, and high EWS activity. In particular, Ru-doped functional porous materials have been becoming one of the most representative EWS catalysts, which can not only achieve the dispersion and adjustment for active Ru sites, but also simultaneously solve the problems of mass transfer and catalytic conversion in EWS.
