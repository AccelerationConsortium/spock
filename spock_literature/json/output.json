They produce C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids which are valuable platform chemicals that can be used directly, or derivatized to service a wide range of chemical industries. However, the application of chain elongating bacteria for synthesizing products beyond C6-C8 medium-chain fatty acids has not been evaluated. In this study, we assess the feasibility of expanding the product spectrum of chain elongating bacteria to C9-C12 fatty acids, along with the synthesis of C6 fatty alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, diols, and methyl ketones. We propose several metabolic engineering strategies to accomplish these conversions in chain elongating bacteria and utilize constraint-based metabolic modelling to predict pathway stoichiometries, assess thermodynamic feasibility, and estimate ATP and product yields. We also evaluate how producing alternative products impacts the growth rate of chain elongating bacteria via resource allocation modelling, revealing a trade-off between product carbon length and class versus cell growth rate. Together, these results highlight the potential for using chain elongating bacteria as a platform for diverse oleochemical biomanufacturing and offer a starting point for guiding future metabolic engineering efforts aimed at expanding their product range.", "topic": [], "author": "Ethan Agena and Ian Gois and Connor M Bowers and Radhakrishnan Mahadevan and Matthew J Scarborough and Christopher Evan Lawson", "year": 2024, "url": "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.06.592817.abstract"}, "Bo Wang": {"title": "Ru-doped functional porous materials for electrocatalytic water splitting", "abstract": "Electrolytic water splitting (EWS) is an attractive and promising technique for the production of hydrogen energy. Nevertheless, the sluggish kinetic rate of hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions leads to a high overpotential and low energy efficiency. Up to date, Pt/Ir-based nanocatalysts have become the state-of-the-art EWS catalysts, but disadvantages such as high cost and low earth abundance greatly limit their applications in EWS devices. As an attractive candidate for the Pt/Ir catalysts, series of Ru-based nanomaterials have aroused much attention for their low price, Pt-like hydrogen bond strength, and high EWS activity. In particular, Ru-doped functional porous materials have been becoming one of the most representative EWS catalysts, which can not only achieve the dispersion and adjustment for active Ru sites, but also simultaneously solve the problems of mass transfer and catalytic conversion in EWS.
