                Question: Does the document mention any new or novel materials discovered?\
                                        Examples sentences for new materials discovery:
                1. Here we report the in vitro validation of eight novel GPCR peptide activators.
                2. The result revealed that novel peptides accumulated only in adenocarcinoma lung cancer cell-derived xenograft tissue.
                3. This led to the discovery of several novel catalyst compositions for ammonia decomposition, which were experimentally\
                    validated against "state-of-the-art" ammonia decomposition catalysts and were\
                    found to have exceptional low-temperature performance at substantially lower weight loadings of Ru.
                4. We applied a workflow of combined in silico methods (virtual drug screening, molecular docking and supervised machine learning algorithms)\
                                        to identify novel drug candidates against COVID-19.\

                -- \
                Does the document mention any new or novel high-throughput or large-scale screening algorithm, methods or workflow?\
                                        Examples sentences for new high-throughput screening algorithms:\
                                       1. In this study, we propose a large-scale (drugâ€“target interactions) DTI prediction system,\
                                        DEEPScreen, for early stage drug discovery,\
                                        using deep convolutional neural network.\
                                       2. We performed a large-scale screening of fast-growing strains with 180 strains isolated\
                                        from 22 ponds located in a wide\
                                        geographic range from the tropics to cool-temperate.\
                                       3. In the present study, we leverage a recently developed high-throughput periodic\
                                        DFT workflow tailored for MOF structures\
                                        to construct a large-scale database of MOF quantum mechanical properties.\
                                        If there are any, what are the screening algorithms used in the document? Answer either\
                                        'Yes' or 'No' followed by a '/' then the exact sentence without any changes\
