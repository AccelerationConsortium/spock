However, the performance of LIBs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to quantify. Having accurate estimations of a battery’s remaining life across different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying used batteries for second-life applications. Since the full history of a battery may not always be available in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that enables dynamic degradation rate prediction, including both short-term and long-term forecasting, while requiring only the most recent battery usage information. Specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series inputs, and predicts the near-term and …'}, 'filled': True, 'author_pub_id': '0Rmr7TwAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC', 'num_citations': 2, 'citedby_url': '/scholar?hl=en&cites=13019386518291301292', 'cites_id': ['13019386518291301292'], 'pub_url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23036782', 'url_related_articles': '/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:rENDCA8nrrQJ:scholar.google.com/', 'cites_per_year': {2024: 2}}
