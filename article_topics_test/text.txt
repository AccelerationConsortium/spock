Here, we report the results from 1,033 clinical DNA tests that included sequencing of RPGR. A total of 184 RPGR variants were identified: 78 pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 14 uncertain, and 92 likely benign or benign. Among the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, 23 were novel, and most were frameshift or nonsense mutations (87%) and enriched (67%) in RPGR exon 15 (ORF15).
