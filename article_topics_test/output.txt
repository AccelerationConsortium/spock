('Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical '

('Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical '
 'space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a tiny '
 'subset can practically be made and tested for a given task. Of those, a mere '
 'handful will advance to the clinic or the market because of regulatory and '
 'economic factors, like Food and Drug Administration approval or Capital '
 'Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is slow, expensive, and high '

('14th century Yersinia pestis genomes support emergence of pestis secunda '
 'within Europe')
('Pestis secunda (1356–1366 CE) is the first of a series of plague outbreaks '
 'in Europe that followed the Black Death (1346–1353 CE). Collectively this '
 'period is called the Second Pandemic. From a genomic perspective, the '
 'majority of post-Black Death strains of Yersinia pestis thus far identified '
 'in Europe display diversity accumulated over a period of centuries that form '
 'a terminal sub-branch of the Y. pestis phylogeny. It has been debated if '
 'these strains arose from local evolution of Y. pestis or if the disease was '
 'repeatedly reintroduced from an external source. Plague lineages descended '
 'from the pestis secunda, however, are thought to have persisted in non-human '
 'reservoirs outside Europe, where they eventually gave rise to the Third '
 'Pandemic (19th and 20th centuries). Resolution of competing hypotheses on '
 'the origins of the many post-Black Death outbreaks has been hindered in part '
