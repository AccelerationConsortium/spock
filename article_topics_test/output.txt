('Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical '

('Closing the Execution Gap in Generative AI for Chemicals and Materials: '
 'Freeways or Safeguards')
('Designing chemicals and materials is a winner-takes-all game in a chemical '
 'space. Out of a nearly endless list of candidate chemicals, only a tiny '
 'subset can practically be made and tested for a given task. Of those, a mere '
 'handful will advance to the clinic or the market because of regulatory and '
 'economic factors, like Food and Drug Administration approval or Capital '
 'Expenditure for manufacturing. This attrition is slow, expensive, and high '
 'stakes; committing to the wrong chemical can ruin a clinical trial or doom a '
 'consumer device. Generative AI has undoubtedly broadened and accelerated the '
 'early stages of chemical design. However, real-world success takes place '
 'further downstream, where the impact of AI has been limited so far. Here, we '
