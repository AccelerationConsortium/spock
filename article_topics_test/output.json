    "title": "History-agnostic battery degradation inference",
    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have attracted widespread attention as an efficient energy storage device on electric vehicles (EV) to achieve emission-free mobility. However, the performance of LIBs deteriorates with time and usage, and the state of health of used batteries are difficult to quantify. Having accurate estimations of a battery\u2019s remaining life across different life stages would benefit maintenance, safety, and serve as a means of qualifying used batteries for second-life applications. Since the full history of a battery may not always be available in downstream applications, in this study, we demonstrate a deep learning framework that enables dynamic degradation rate prediction, including both short-term and long-term forecasting, while requiring only the most recent battery usage information. Specifically, our model takes a rolling window of current and voltage time-series inputs, and predicts the near-term and \u2026",

    "title": "Clinical sequencing of the retinitis pigmentosa gene RPGR in over 1,000 cases of vision loss",
    "abstract": "RPGR pathogenic variants are the major cause of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we report the results from 1,033 clinical DNA tests that included sequencing of RPGR. A total of 184 RPGR variants were identified: 78 pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 14 uncertain, and 92 likely benign or benign. Among the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants, 23 were novel, and most were frameshift or nonsense mutations (87%) and enriched (67%) in RPGR exon 15 (ORF15). Identical pathogenic variants found in different families were largely on different haplotype backgrounds, indicating relatively frequent, recurrent RPGR mutations. None of the 16 mother/affected son pairs showed de novo mutations; all 16 mothers were heterozygous for the pathogenic variant. These last two observations support the occurrence of most RPGR mutations in the male germline.",

    "title": "A data-driven framework to improve the wear resistance of a low-alloy steel fabricated by laser powder bed fusion",
    "abstract": "The laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technique provides an opportunity to precisely control process parameters and produce materials with desired microstructure, which play an important role in developing wear-resistance components. An accurate and efficient determination of the optimal process window for new materials, however, remains a highly sought yet challenging task due to a high experimental cost by trial and error. In this study, we demonstrate a physics-informed data-driven framework to create a 3D process map and optimize printing parameters (i.e., laser power (P), scan speed (v), and hatch distance (h)) for a newly designed low-alloy steel. First, we establish a highly precise P-v process map by thoroughly exploring kernel selection and parameter hyper-tuning in Gaussian process regression (GPR) models. Subsequently, we employ the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm with different \u2026",
